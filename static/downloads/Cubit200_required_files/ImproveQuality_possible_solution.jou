##### Determine which volume has the worst quality
qual vol all scaled
list hex 18816
##### The worst quality element is 18816, which is in vol 6.  Unite vol 6 with
##### some of its neighbors to give the smoother freedom.
unite volume 6 1 4  include_mesh 

##### Now smooth the surface meshes so we can see what is going on in that tangled mess
smooth surface 6
smooth surface 26

##### Do some Mesh Surgery then smooth

##### Now see where the worst quality is
qual vol all scal
list hex 2733
draw vol 12

##### Worst quality is now hex 2733, which is in volume 12.  The problem is the skew
##### on a skinny boundary surface of vol 12.  If we unite vol 12 with vol 6, then that
##### surface goes away giving the smoother freedom to smooth

##### min scaled Jacobian is now 0.242, good enough, so we stop.
