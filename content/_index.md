### Don't mesh, just simulate
{{% /centering %}}        

Coreform IGA is a new solver that runs directly on CAD, lattice structure, and stl files. Unlike traditional FEA that first requires geometry to be defeatured and meshed, Coreform IGA is based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) technology and accepts a broad range of inputs and file formats.
