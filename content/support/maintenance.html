            <p>No additional maintenance cost is required for customers with lease licenses.
                Lease licenses include software updates and Standard Technical Support
                for the length of the lease.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subhead">Maintenance for perpetual-use licenses.</h3>
            <p>Customers who purchase a perpetual-use (paid-up) license of Coreform software receive 
                a license to use the then released version of the software in perpetuity 
                and <a href="/support/supportpackages">Standard Technical Support</a> for 
                the first year. After the first year, customers can get new releases, 
                software updates, and continued <a href="/support/supportpackages">Standard 
                Technical Support</a> by paying an annual maintenance fee. See 
                <i>Maintenance Cost</i> below.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subhead">Maintenance cost.</h3>
            <p>Software maintenance is included with your annual lease. For customers
                with perpetual-use licenses, the Software Maintenance Program is included
                for the first year and is available for an additional annual fee for
                subsequent years. <a href="/company/contact">Contact Coreform</a>
                for a current maintenance information.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subhead">Lapsed maintenance.</h3>
            <p>Coreform customers who purchase a perpetual-use license will renew their 
                maintenance each year. If the software maintenance expires, updates and 
                support are no longer available. To renew lapsed maintenance, you will 
                need to pay the maintenance fee for the period during which your maintenance 
                was expired, in addition to the current annual maintenance fee.</p>
