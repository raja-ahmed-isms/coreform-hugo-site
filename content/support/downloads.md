# Licensing downloads

### RLM-Server manages floating licenses on a network, allowing multiple users to share licenses.

The RLM-Server is the license manager for using floating licenses on a network. Install RLM-Server on a
designated license server and activate the floating license. Then, install the software on any network
computer whether Windows, Linux, or Mac.

RLM Server downloads have moved to [the products downloads page](/products/downloads).
