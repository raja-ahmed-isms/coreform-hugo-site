# Coreform Cubit node-locked activation

A node-locked license is a single license that can be used on a single computer.  

Product license keys are used to activate Coreform software. Below are instructions for activating node-locked licenses. Activation of Coreform software can be done online or, if the computer is not connected to the Internet, by downloading a unique license file. (If your computer is not connected to the Internet, please see [Offline Activation](/support/activation/activateoffline).)

To activate a node-locked license of Coreform Cubit on a stand-alone computer with an Internet connection:

### 1. Retrieve your product key 

* Log in to your Coreform account and select the “My Licenses” link on the left sidebar.  
* Click the relevant “Coreform Cubit 202x.x” link to view your license details. 
* Carefully record the Product Key supplied in the License section: you will use this to activate Coreform Cubit in step #3 below.
