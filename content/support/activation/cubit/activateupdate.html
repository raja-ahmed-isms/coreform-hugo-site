            <h3 class="section-subhead">Update a node-locked License.</h3>
            <p>A node-locked license is installed on a single standalone computer, whether or not it is connected to a network.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The local license file needs to be updated when upgrading to a minor release. For example, 20.1 to 20.2. 
                However, the license file does not need to be updated for maintenance releases, such as 16.0.1 or 16.0.2.</p>
            <p>To upgrade a node-locked license to a new version,</p>
                <div class="inner">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Download the software update installation package for your computer's operating system from the 
                        My Downloads area of your Coreform account.</li>
                        <li>Install the software on the same computer where the software was previously 
                        installed and activated. The software will by default install to a folder 
                        with the version number (for example, c:\Program Files\Coreform Cubit 2020.2). 
                        Maintenance releases will install into the same folder as the release version. (Cubit 
                        20.2 installs into c:\Program Files\Coreform Cubit 2020.2)</li>
                        <li>Launch the application. <br/>
                            <ul class="indent">
                                <li><strong>If the license is not valid</strong>, the application will not launch and an activation window will open letting you know that no valid license was found. Enter a valid product key and press Activate. <br/><br/><img class="dropshadow" src="/images/activate_standalone.jpg"/></li>
                                <li><strong>If the license is still valid</strong>, but needs to be updated, click Product Activation on the Help menu to open the Product Activation window. <br/><br/><img src="/images/activate_help.jpg"/></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>In the Product Activation window, enter the product key that is found on the license page under My Licenses and click 
                            Activate. <br/><br/><img class="dropshadow" src="/images/activate_standalone_active.jpg"/></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If the license is not activated, an error message will appear in the lower left corner of the window. Possible errors are 
                        incorrect permissions to save to the license folder or the application cannot connect to the activation server because 
                        of no Internet connection or blocked by a firewall.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> A node-locked product key will activate the application for the local computer only. A node-locked 
                        application cannot be activates using a floating product key.</p>

          <h3 class="section-subhead">Update a floating License.</h3>
            <p>If the expiration date or some other option of your license changes, the license on your license server must be updated to reflect 
                the change. Updating a floating license involves re-activating the floating license in a similar way to the original activation. 
                You might also need to update the license manager on the server and update the application on computers connected to the network, 
                if newer versions are available. </p>
            <h4>Updating the RLM-Server.</h4>
                    <p>Although previous versions of RLM-Server should still manage newer application licenses, we recommend that you 
                        update the RLM-Server to match the version of the application you are using. For example, a Cubit 20.2 license will run on RLM-Server 20.1, 
                        but we recommend updating to RLM-Server 20.2.</p>
                    <p>To update the RLM-Server:</p>
                    <div class="inner">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Uninstall the older license manager. This can be done by running the uninstall utility located in the RLM-Server folder. 
                            Several files will remain in the folder after uninstalling RLM-Server, including the license file.</li>
                        <li><a href="/support/downloads/">Download the new RLM-Server</a>.</li>
                        <li>Install the updated RLM-Server software on the server. For more information, see <a href="/support/activation/rlmserverinstall/">RLM-Server 
                            installation instructions</a>.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            <h4>Updating the floating license on the license server.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The local license file in the RLM-Server folder of the license server must be updated whenever a change is made 
                        to the license, such as a change to the expiration date or a version upgrade. However, the license file does not need to be updated 
                        for maintenance releases, such as 20.2.1 or 20.2.2.</p>
                    <p>To update the floating license on the license server,</p>
                    <h5>Windows</h5>
                    <div class="inner">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Run the rlm_activate utility to open the Product Activation dialog.</li>
                        <li>On the Product Activation dialog, enter the product key and press Activate. The software license is now updated.<br/><br/><img class="dropshadow" src="/images/activate_server_active.jpg"/></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                    <h5>Linux or Mac OS X</h5>
                    <div class="inner">

                    <ol>
                        <li>From a terminal run as administrator: <br/><br/><code>.\rlm_activate --activate &lt;product_key&gt; &lt;hostname&gt;</code><br/><br/>
                            where &lt;product_key&gt; is the product key for the license and &lt;hostname&gt;
                            is the name of the server . The hostname is optional, but will identify the server in your list of licenses in your
                            account.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            <h4>Updating the workstation software to the latest version.</h4>
                    <p>If the application version has changed, you should install the new software version on each computer that will access the license over the network.</p>
                    <p>To install the new version,</p>
                    <div class="inner">

                    <ol>
                        <li>Download the appropriate application from your My Downloads in your Coreform account.</li>
                        <li>Install the application update on each network computer where the application will be run.</li>
                        <li>During the installation process, you will be prompted to setup the license. Select <strong>Floating: Connect to a license server</strong>. 
                            Enter the IP address or hostname of the license server, where RLM-Server is installed and activated. Press Connect.
                            <br/><br/><img class="dropshadow" src="/images/activate_connect_active.jpg"/></li>
                    </ol>
                    
                </div>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> A floating product key should not be used to activate a node-locked license. A floating product key can only be used to 
                    activate or update a floating license on the license server where RLM-Server is installed. Conversely, a standalone product key cannot be used 
                    to activate a floating license.</p>
