            <h3>Company.</h3>
            <p>Coreform LLC develops highly accurate and integrated simulation tools for automotive, aerospace and other 
                engineering professionals. Founded in 2014 and based in Provo, Utah. Coreform is a remote-first company that hires employees across the United States. The company uses smooth CAD geometry 
                directly in simulation for faster and more accurate results.</p>
            <p>Coreform is addressing one of the most significant opportunities today in the computer-aided engineering 
                market: unifying CAE with CAD. Every year, hundreds of millions of dollars and significant manual effort 
                is wasted converting accurate CAD data to approximated mesh representations for CAE. This antiquated workflow 
                is only necessary because CAD and CAE software rely on 40-year-old incompatible technologies, which introduces 
                significant inefficiencies and severely limits the role simulation might play in product development. To 
                address this, Coreform invented U-splines, the first commercially viable technology suitable for both highly 
                accurate analysis and CAD. U-splines are compatible with both NURBS and FEA meshes, and accurately describe 
                objects both for design and simulation &mdash; without any translation steps. U-splines offer promising applications 
                in both mature and emerging markets.</p>
            <p>Coreform's founders are world experts in this field, and include Dr. Tom Hughes, member of the National Academy 
                of Sciences and inventor of isogeometric analysis (IGA); Mr. Matthew Sederberg, former CEO of T-Splines 
                (acquired by Autodesk in 2011), which introduced a next-generation modeling paradigm now widely used in CAD 
                and industrial design; Dr. Michael Scott, pioneer in IGA and analysis-suitable geometry; Dr. Derek Thomas, 
                inventor of U-splines; and Dr. Kevin Tew, expert in high-performance computing.</p>
            <p>Join our team on an exciting adventure, funded by a number of commercial and government partners. Working at 
                Coreform is both challenging and rewarding, and you will make fundamental, meaningful contributions. There 
                are three areas of development at our company: a next-generation analysis-suitable geometry kernel (U-splines and Flex Representation Method), 
                a preprocessor (Coreform Cubit), and an isogeometric solver (Coreform IGA). You will be focused on the 
                isogeometric solver. Coreform offers market salaries to its employees with a bonus structure to allow employees 
                the opportunity to participate in the growth and success of the company.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px; line-height:0.8em;">Salary: Commensurate with experience</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px; line-height:0.8em;">Benefits: Bonuses, health insurance, physical fitness credit</p>
            
            <h3>Supervisory responsibilities.</h3>
            <p>This position is an individual contributor and has no supervisory responsibilities.</p>

            <h3>Work environment.</h3>
            <p>Coreform is a highly collaborative workplace, and you will work closely with world experts in CAD, FEA, and high 
                performance computing. We celebrate self-starters that are motivated by solving challenging problems, not just 
                by punching a timeclock. Outside of work, we encourage employees to live healthy, balance lives through our employee 
                health credit.</p>
