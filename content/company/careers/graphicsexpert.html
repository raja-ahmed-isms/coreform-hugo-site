            <h3>Company.</h3>
            <p>Coreform LLC develops highly accurate and integrated simulation tools for automotive, aerospace and other engineering professionals. Founded in 2014 and based in Provo, Utah. Coreform is a remote-first company that hires employees across the United States. The company uses smooth CAD geometry directly in simulation for faster and more accurate results.</p>
            <p>Coreform is addressing one of the most significant opportunities today in the computer-aided engineering market: unifying CAE with CAD. Every year, hundreds of millions of dollars and significant manual effort is wasted converting accurate CAD data to approximated mesh representations for CAE. This antiquated workflow is only necessary because CAD and CAE software rely on 40-year-old incompatible technologies, which introduces significant inefficiencies and severely limits the role simulation might play in product development. To address this, Coreform invented U-splines, the first commercially viable technology suitable for both highly accurate analysis and CAD. U-splines are compatible with both NURBS and FEA meshes, and accurately describe objects both for design and simulation &mdash; without any translation steps. U-splines offer promising applications in both mature and emerging markets.</p>
            <p>Coreform's founders are world experts in this field, and include Dr. Tom Hughes, member of the National Academy of Sciences and inventor of isogeometric analysis (IGA); Mr. Matthew Sederberg, former CEO of T-Splines (acquired by Autodesk in 2011), which introduced a next-generation modeling paradigm now widely used in CAD and industrial design; Dr. Michael Scott, pioneer in IGA and analysis-suitable geometry; Dr. Derek Thomas, inventor of U-splines; and Dr. Kevin Tew, expert in high-performance computing.</p>
            <p>Join our team on an exciting adventure, funded by a number of commercial and government partners. Working at Coreform is both challenging and rewarding, and you will make fundamental, meaningful contributions. There are three areas of development at our company: a next-generation analysis-suitable geometry kernel (U-splines and Flex Representation Method), a preprocessor (Coreform Cubit), and an isogeometric solver (Coreform IGA). You will be focused on the isogeometric solver. Coreform offers market salaries to its employees with a bonus structure to allow employees the opportunity to participate in the growth and success of the company.</p>

            <h3>Position details.</h3>
            <p>The Computer Graphics and Computational Geometry developer will expand and mature Coreform's C++ U-splines geometry and Flex Representation Method
                libraries. The working environment and architecture consists of C++ geometry processing and finite element analysis 
                libraries, which will be coupled to a 3d WebGL rendering engine. A qualified applicant will be capable of evaluating, 
                selecting, and implementing appropriate technologies to solve large-scale engineering problems.</p>
            <p>Salary: Commensurate with experience</p>
            <p>Benefits: Bonuses, health insurance, physical fitness credit</p>

            <h3>Work environment.</h3>
            <p>Coreform is a highly collaborative workplace, and you will work closely with world experts in CAD, FEA, and high 
                performance computing. We celebrate self-starters that are motivated by solving challenging problems, not just 
                by punching a timeclock. Outside of work, we encourage employees to live healthy, balance lives through our employee 
                health credit.</p>
            <h3>Location.</h3>
            <p>Coreform LLC is a remote-first company with headquarters in Orem, Utah. Located approximately 45 minute south of Salt Lake City,
