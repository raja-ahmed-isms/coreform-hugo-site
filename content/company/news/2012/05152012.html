    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, <i>May 15, 2012</i> &mdash; csimsoft, a leading provider of
        pre-processing tools for the CFD and FEA industries, announced today that
        it intends to release the next generation of the popular Cubit pre-processor
        under a new brand name. The name is to be announced in an event scheduled
        for July 27 in American Fork, Utah.</p>
    <p>Based on the Cubit 13.2 code, csimsoft is adding functionality to specifically
        meet the needs of its growing CFD user base and to satisfy requests of its
        FEA users. "The Cubit code has been enhanced and improved for more than two
        decades," says Randy Morris, csimsoft Managing Director. "Now we're taking
        the code to an even higher level." The next generation product is to include
        improved support for solver formats; improved boundary layer meshing; and many
        other new features.</p>
    <p>Since its beginning, Cubit has lead the industry in hexahedral meshing. It is
        distinguished by its robust geometry defeaturing tools and its ability to hex
        mesh extremely large, complex models. "We are committed to giving our users
        the ability to generate high-quality meshes," says Dr. Karl Merkley, Director
        of R&D. "We know their analysis depends on it. This next gen product represents
        a significant milestone for the CFD and FEA communities."</p>
    <p>The next generation product will be available to current Cubit customers as a
        regular maintenance release.</p>
    <h4>About Cubit</h4>
    <p>The Cubit project began in 1991 at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
        New Mexico. Most of the csimsoft team participated in the early Cubit development.
        csimsoft co-founder Michael Stephenson and Sandia's Ted Blacker developed the
        original Cubit hex meshing algorithms and published their work in 1991. Another
        csimsoft co-founder, Ray Meyers, was Sandia's Cubit project lead from 1992-1994.
        The remaining members of the csimsoft engineering team have worked on the Cubit
        project for more than a decade, and, working closely with SNL, provided the
        majority of the Cubit development.</p>
    <h4>About csimsoft</h4>
    <p>csimsoft is a leading developer of pre-processing solutions for the computational
        fluid dynamics and finite element analysis communities. csimsoft, founded in 2004
        to commercialize the Cubit software, is now the exclusive developer of the next
        generation pre-processor. csimsoft is headquartered in Utah. (<a
