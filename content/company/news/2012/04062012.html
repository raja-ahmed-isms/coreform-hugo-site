    <p>MOSCOW, RUSSIA and AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, <i>April 6, 2012</i> &mdash; The innovative 
        Russian software developer, Fidesys, LLC has joined with Computational 
        Simulation Software, LLC ("csimsoft"), a global leader in pre-processing 
        software for CFD and FEA, to develop the next generation of FIDESYS, the 
        first Russian-language, multi-purpose CAE software for high-end structural 
        analysis.</p>
    <p>FIDESYS is computer-aided engineering program designed to solve static and 
        dynamic strength problems of stress and strain states of solids under finite 
        strains. Cubit is a pre-processor used to create tetrahedral and hexahedral 
        meshes that are used in finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics. 
        "The combination of these two programs creates a powerful solution for CAE 
        engineering professionals," said Paul Ressler, Director of Marketing at csimsoft.  
        "We are thrilled to see our technology being deployed in such an innovative analysis tool."</p>
    <p>According to Vladmir Levine, ScD professor at MSU and Fidesys CEO, FIDESYS is 
        Russia's first analysis package of this level and will more fully meet the needs 
        of the CAE market in Russia. Based on innovative technology developed at the Moscow 
        State University, FIDESYS is gaining international recognition for its high accuracy 
        of calculations and simulations due to utilization of new scientifically approved 
        methods. The FIDESYS strength analysis package will be popular primarily among 
        sectors worldwide that require strength analysis. "The main difference between 
        our method and the Western one is that we use two calculation cores," says Anatoly 
        Vershinin, a professor at MSU Engineering and Mathematics Department and one 
        of the main project inspirers.</p>
