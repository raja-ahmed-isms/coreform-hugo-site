    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, <i>January 5, 2012</i> &mdash; Computational Simulation 
        Software, LLC (csimsoft), a leader in pre-processor technology, today 
        announced maintenance amnesty for all previous versions of Cubit prior to 
        March 1, 2012. All previous Cubit licenses may be upgraded to the recently 
        released Cubit 13.1 for the cost of a single year of maintenance.</p>
    <p>"The amnesty allows those with older licenses of Cubit to get version 13.1 no 
        matter how much back maintenance is owed," commented Paul Ressler, Director 
        of Sales and Marketing for csimsoft. "This decision is in keeping with our 
        customer service record and commitment to increasing the use of Cubit."</p>
