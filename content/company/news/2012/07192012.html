    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, <i>July 19, 2012</i> &mdash; csimsoft announced today the
        release of Cubit 13.2, its latest version of the Cubit pre-processor for
        generating high-quality tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes for the CFD and
        FEA communities.</p>
    <p>The latest version of Cubit includes improved meshing and geometry features,
        a new 64-bit tet mesher, and improved third-party format support. "The new
        features in 13.2 demonstrate our responsiveness to our customers' needs,"
        says Paul Ressler, Director of Sales and Marketing. "It represents our on-going
        commitment to provide superior meshing tools to the worldwide community of
        engineering professions." Included in the list of new features are:</p>
    <p><b>Remesh Tet Command</strong> � The new remesh tet command can replace deformed
            or poor quality tetrahedra after an analysis where some portion of the mesh is deformed.</p>
    <p><b>64-bit Tet Mesher</strong> � The new 64-bit tet mesher that allows for significantly
            larger meshes than Cubit's previous tet mesher.</p>
    <p><b>Defeaturing Power Tool</strong> � This new power tool reduces the defeaturing of
            solid models to a single button click or command.</p>
