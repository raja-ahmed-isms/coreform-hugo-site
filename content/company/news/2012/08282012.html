    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, August 28, 2012 &mdash; csimsoft has launched a new video
        library to demonstrate Cubit's pre-processing features, including Cubit
        Power Tools, the ITEM wizard, and powerful scripting and journal files
        for parameterizing the construction of models to determine design sensitivity
        and to capture and share repetitive meshing processes.</p>
    <p>"Cubit users quickly discover that there is a lot of power underneath the
        hood," says Randy Morris, csimsoft Managing Director, "The new video library
        will introduce them to Cubit's capabilities and help them understand how Cubit
        simplifies geometry clean up and meshing."</p>
    <p>Also included in the library are the Introduction to Cubit and the Cubit
        Overview videos. csimsoft plans to release additional Cubit "how-to" videos
        on various topics of interest for CFD and FEA.</p>
