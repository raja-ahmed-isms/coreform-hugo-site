Dr. David Kamensky, highly cited fluid-structure researcher and assistant professor at the University of California at San Diego, has taken a full-time position at Coreform. Dr. Kamensky, in addition to his renowned fluid dynamics research, has served on numerous conference committees and as co-organizer of multiple conference symposia on isogeometric analysis.

Creating a native isogeometric analysis solver is a complex and demanding task, so Coreform is always looking for the best and most creative minds. More than 80% of Coreform’s existing development team hold advanced degrees and several have invented new methods in computer-aided engineering.

Dr. Kamensky spent over a decade in academia doing interdisciplinary research at the intersection of engineering, computer science, and applied mathematics, to improve and automate computer simulations of fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and fluid--structure interaction. He has co-authored over 30 peer-reviewed journal articles, including several that have been recognized as highly cited by Web of Science.
