The offical release of **Coreform Cubit 2023.11** can now be downloaded at [Coreform.com.](https://coreform.com/products/downloads/) The complete release notes can be found [on our website](https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/release_notes/v2023.11/). A free webinar is available to demonstrate the new DAGMC integration.

**Introducing DAGMC integration** 

Coreform is pleased to announce Coreform Cubit 2023.11, which features many new capabilities and improvements improving support for nuclear energy applications. Enhancements include an exporter to the DAGMC radiation transport code, improvements to the ABAQUS export to support the MCNP radiation transport code, as well as an MCNP importer that reconstructs MCNP models within Coreform Cubit. A new coarse trimesher setting was added to support producing meshes for radiation transport codes used within the nuclear energy industry. 

Previously available as a plugin to Coreform Cubit, DAGMC functionality is now natively available in Coreform Cubit, with improved meshing and export capabilities. DAGMC can be used to set up CAD-based neutronics simulations in OpenMC, MCNP, and other Monte Carlo solvers.

**Free webinar**

Coreform is sponsoring a free webinar in which Dr. Patrick Shriwise will demonstrate how to set up and run OpenMC simulations based on CAD using the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) functionality now available in Coreform Cubit 2023.11. Dr. Shriwise will show example geometries from both nuclear fission and fusion.

Dr. Shriwise is a computational scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. He develops and performs research with OpenMC, an open-source continuous energy Monte Carlo particle transport code and DAGMC, an open-source toolkit for performing particle transport on CAD-based tessellation geometry.
