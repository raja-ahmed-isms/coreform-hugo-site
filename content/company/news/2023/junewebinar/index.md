On June 29th at 9am Mountain time, Wilford Smith will present a webinar demonstrating how to use Coreform Cubit and Python to develop the case directory structure for OpenFOAM.

He will use the example case of a small converging-diverging supersonic nozzle to show how Coreform Cubit’s broad meshing capabilities and powerful Python scripting API can be used to prepare models for analysis in OpenFOAM CFD.

Wilford Smith is an independent fluid dynamics and heat transfer consultant at Omega First with over 40 years of experience in complex fluid dynamics and heat transfer analysis.
