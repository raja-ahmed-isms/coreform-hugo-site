Our [most recent webinar](https://coreform.com/support/webinars/) is now available for viewing. 

In this webinar, Dr. Patrick Shriwise demonstrated how to setup and run OpenMC simulations based on CAD using the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) functionality available in Coreform Cubit 2023.11. Dr. Shriwise showed example geometries from both nuclear fission and fusion and walked through how to use Coreform Cubit with OpenMC and MCNP.

A full transcript of the webinar Q&A, including questions that were asked but not answered during the webinar, [is available here](https://forum.coreform.com/t/webinar-q-a-responses-openmc-neutronics-simulations-of-cad-based-geometry-using-dagmc-and-coreform-cubit/2075). 

Previously available as a plugin to Coreform Cubit, DAGMC functionality is now natively available in Coreform Cubit, with improved meshing and export capabilities. DAGMC can be used to set up CAD-based neutronics simulations in OpenMC, MCNP, and other Monte Carlo solvers.
