Coreform, a leading provider of commercial-grade software solutions for engineering and scientific simulation, announces its recent receipt of a highly competitive Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant from the United States Department of Energy (DOE). This grant will support an innovative project aimed at addressing key limitations in the Office of Nuclear Energy's computer modeling and simulation tools for nuclear reactor design and testing.

The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy has developed the powerful MOOSE platform which is frequently used for simulating both light-water and non-light water reactors. Coreform's expertise in software development, coupled with the support of the DOE SBIR grant, will drive the successful integration of next-generation isogeometric analysis technology and GPU compatibility into the open-source MOOSE framework. These advancements will revolutionize nuclear reactor simulations, providing a more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly solution for the design and analysis of both light-water and non-light water reactors.
