Chemical and biological engineering graduate student Nicholas Glover from SUNY Buffalo used Coreform Cubit Learn to model the glomerular capillary wall of a kidney. Glomeruli dysfunction is the cause of chronic kidney disease.

After watching this [webinar on automatic hex meshing for biological and material sciences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAe80xLPbWY), and following a recommended Sculpt tool workflow from our [forum](https://forum.coreform.com), Nicholas was able to create a high quality mesh and get good results in FEBio, an open-source FEA package. Well done Nicholas, and thanks for sharing your work!
Coreform Cubit’s powerful hex meshing tools and seamless integration with a variety of solvers make it a great option for students and academics. Watch [Coreform.com](https://forum.coreform.com) for a formal case study later this year.
