Our [most recent webinar](https://coreform.com/support/webinars/) reviewed all the top reasons that engineers choose to use Coreform Cubit for challenging simulations and third-party solvers. Coreform Cubit is a general-purpose meshing software used by thousands of engineers in government, industry, and academia. It is based on the Exodus file format for seamless use with many other government-developed simulation codes such as MOOSE, Truchas, Nalu, ParaView, and VisIt.

Coreform Cubit contains a Python interface that can be used from within Cubit or in an external Python environment. It also features best-in-class manual decomposition tools for hex meshing, as well as support for quad-tri, hex/wedge/pyramid/tet meshing for 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D. Coreform Cubit also excels as a direct modeler, offering excellent precision. Between Coreform’s features and its powerful Python interface, it is an ideal choice for use with third-party solvers and for users who need hex mesh quality on difficult geometry.

Coreform Cubit is primarily a meshing tool, not a simulation input generator. As such it lacks robust card generation for boundary conditions, load conditions, contact setup, etc. It does not support local coordinate systems or polyhedral elements, and does not have a constrained 2d/3d sketcher interface.
