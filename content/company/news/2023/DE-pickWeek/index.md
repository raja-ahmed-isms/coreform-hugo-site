This honor punctuated the largest revenue growth year (2022) in Coreform Cubit’s venerable history of providing hex and tet meshing solutions for the most challenging simulations.

[Digital Engineering](https://www.digitalengineering247.com/article/editors-pick-faster-meshing-for-simulation?oly_enc_id=99999999999999999) noted that Coreform Cubit includes capabilities for streamlined progress from CAD to analysis, with full-featured capabilities for geometry preparation and mesh generation, analysis, and fine-tuning. Preparing CAD geometry for meshing consumes more time and resources than any other stage of the CAE process, so Coreform Cubit provides powerful, user-guided automated tools to make geometry cleanup and simplification fast and satisfying.

The Digital Engineering article highlights some of the enhancements made in the 2022.11 Coreform Cubut release. Existing users can [download](https://coreform.com/products/downloads/) the release, and  [free trials](https://coreform.com/products/trial/) (along with free engineering consultation) are also available.

1-The ability to import “superelement” block types from exodus files 

2- Improvements in how to obtain meshes from blocks, sidesets and notesets.

3- The  draw command now allows new portions to be added to the model.

4- MeshGems HPC technology (MG-Tetra_hpc) is now the default tet mesher in Coreform Cubit.

5- Remesh for groups of triangles has been added to the Remesh commands. 

6- There are two new enhancements to Sculpt, “resample” and “material”. 

7- A new webcut operation has been added,  allowing a volume to be cut with surfaces offset from its bounding surfaces.

8-  STEP Import/Export has been enhanced; the user can now assign names to geometry entities. Those names will be written into a STEP file upon export.
