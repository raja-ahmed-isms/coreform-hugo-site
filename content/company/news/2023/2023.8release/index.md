The offical release of **Coreform Cubit 2023.8** can be downloaded at [Coreform.com.](https://coreform.com/products/downloads/) The complete release notes can be found [here.](https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/release_notes/v2023.8/) 

**Introducing machine learning** 
With this release, Coreform Cubit includes machine learning capabilities to further speed up the meshing process and reduce user tedium. Coreform Cubit 2023.8 has been trained to recognize common fasteners such as bolts, nuts, pins, and other connectors. Engineers can use this to rapidly identify these fasteners in their models and quickly simplify, remove, or replace them. Users can also train Cubit to recognize their own common parts to perform similar simplifications. 

This machine learning technology has been developed by Sandia National Laboratory; the lead developer of the technology, Dr. Steven Owen, will give two free webinars to Coreform Cubit users, introducing the technology and how to use it. The first webinar, [Machine Learning in Coreform Cubit, Part 1: Part Defeaturing](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_LFmquMx_R6CV0l3t4bBUhw), will be held on August 31st. The second webinar, [Machine Learning in Coreform Cubit, Part 2: Part Classification and Reduction](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Cj2ZIB_GTxe0KWONMPpgWA), will be held on September 7th. 

 **Additional functionality in Coreform Cubit 2023.8** 
 Additional changes with this release include improvements to the polyhedra meshing scheme, a new equi-angle skew metric, improved SDK documentation, user experience improvements, and bug fixes. A complete list of these improvements is available in the [Coreform Cubit documentation] (https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/release_notes/v2023.8/). 
 
 **.cf file format**
 Additionally, the U-splines isogeometric analysis technology previously available in Cubit has been removed in advance of its inclusion in a new dedicated isogeometric analysis preprocessor currently being developed by Coreform. A new ‘.cf’ export file format has been added to Coreform Cubit to facilitate a future workflow for creating body fit meshes in Cubit for conversion to U-splines in this new software, Coreform Flex, which is currently in beta testing. Interested parties are invited to contact matt@coreform.com if they wish to test this new IGA workflow.
