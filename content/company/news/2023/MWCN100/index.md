MountainWest Capital Network (MWCN) announced its 2023 winners at an event on October 12th, and Orem-based Coreform was, for the third year in a row, the highest-ranking computer-aided engineering (CAE) software company in Utah. The Utah 100 Companies are ranked according to a weighted average calculation of percentage and dollar growth between 2018 and 2022.

“We are proud to be recognized for our hard work in developing next-generation engineering simulation software,” said Michael Scott, CEO of Coreform. “Our team has embraced the challenges of developing disruptive technology and is ready to grow even more in the coming years .”

Earlier this year, Coreform was also recognized as one of the top fastest-growing companies in the United States by Inc. 5000. Coreform ranked #4043 overall nationwide, and was the top CAE company. 

Coreform software accelerates product development by enabling engineers to predict real-world behavior with higher accuracy, faster solution time, and faster model preparation than traditional finite element analysis. “None of this happens in a vacuum,” adds Matthew Sederberg, Chief Strategy Office at Coreform. “We appreciate the efforts of the state of Utah and the MWCN to foster a great environment for business growth.” 

“We congratulate all of this year’s Utah 100 companies for building outstanding businesses and making strong contributions to Utah’s economy,” said Jason Roberts, Chairman of the MWCN Utah 100 committee. “These companies further advance Utah’s standing as an excellent place to do business.”
