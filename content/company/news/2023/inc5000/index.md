Inc. magazine revealed on August, 15th 2023 that Coreform LLC is once again on its list of the 5000 fastest growing companies in the nation. Coreform is, for the fourth time, the highest-ranking computer-aided engineering (CAE) company on the annual list. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment -- independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Facebook, Chobani, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other household-name brands gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc.5000.

“Running a business has only gotten harder since the end of the pandemic,” says Inc. editor-in-chief Scott Omelianuk. “To make the Inc. 5000 -- with the fast growth that requires — is truly an accomplishment. Inc. is thrilled to honor the companies that are building our future.”

Appearing on the Inc. 5000 list is an accomplishment in itself. Fewer than 1 in 5 companies that appear on the list are recognized more than three times. This marks the fourth year that Coreform LLC, based in Orem, UT, has been recognized by Inc. magazine for its growth. This year, Coreform was ranked #4043 and was the highest-ranked CAE company in the nation. Coreform develops innovative isogeometric analysis software for finite element analysis, as well as serving as the sole commercial distributor of Sandia National Laboratories’ Cubit meshing software.

The Inc. 5000 class of 2023 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. In all, this year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 1,187,266 jobs to the economy over the past three years.
