As the International Association for the Engineering, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Community, NAFEMS is widely recognized as the leading independent source of information and training for engineering analysts and designers of all levels. The ASSESS Congress 2023 will bring together the leading visionaries, developers, and practitioners of CAE-related technologies in an open forum, unlike any other, to share experiences, discuss relevant trends, discover common themes, and explore future issues. The goal is to provide attendees with the best thought-provoking content to deploy simulation now and in the future.

Coreform will have two of its leadership team in attendance, and is contributing to the development and advancement of simulation by participating as a platinum sponsor. Follow us on social media for updates on the conference as it happens.

The conference will be highly interactive, splitting into several theme workshops where participants will meet, discuss, and report to the main plenary. As such, registration is limited to just over 100 participants.

The ASSESS Congress 2023 will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, between March 26th and 28th. This is not a traditional conference, but an opportunity for thought leaders to work as one to map out the future of engineering simulation and lead the way toward it. Coreform is a platinum sponsor of this event.
