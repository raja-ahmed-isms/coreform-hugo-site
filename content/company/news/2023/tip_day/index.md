Coreform Cubit includes a pop-up that can optionally appear when you launch the application that shows a new suggestion about how you can maximize your use of Coreform Cubit each day. Access it from the Help menu by choosing “Cubit tips”.

For instance, did you know that the right-click context menu contains a host of useful tools that are specific to your current context?

Or, that one of the best ways to avoid tolerance problems is to scale small models?
