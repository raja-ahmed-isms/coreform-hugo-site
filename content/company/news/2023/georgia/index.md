Isaac Naupa is a first-year graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He serves as the Technical Lead on a Multiphysics Benchmark Evaluation for the Sytems for Nuclear Auxiliary Program. His project involves validating several codes in the NEAMS suite, specifically MOOSE, BISON, GRIFFIN, and PRONGHORN, in the context of microreactor technology applications.

These simulations follow a two-step process. First, there is a high fidelity pre-generation stage of nuclear parameters. Second, for easier integration into a multiphysics workflow, the data is fed into reduced order models. The communication between the high fidelity model and the reduced order models needs to be tailored appropriately to ensure proper simulations.

Coreform Cubit’s Python interface allows easy integration with scripting workflows, and it supports the Exodus format. The ability to export meshes with tailored parameters directly into the Exodus format is key for working in the MOOSE environment. Coreform Cubit will be used to develop a sequence to assist in validating MOOSE-based tools as potential design and licensing tools for microreactor applications.

Coreform offers a free, export-limited version of its premiere meshing toolkit, Coreform Cubit Learn, exclusively for student and hobbyist use.
