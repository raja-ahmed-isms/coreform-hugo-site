Our [most recent webinar](https://coreform.com/support/webinars/) is now available for viewing. 

Doctoral candidate Alexander Berne uses Coreform Cubit at the California Institute of Technology to study the geodynamics of the planetary satellite Enceladus. In this webinar, he demonstrated how he uses Coreform Cubit’s powerful scripting tools in his research and showed how Coreform Cubit can be used for geodynamics.
