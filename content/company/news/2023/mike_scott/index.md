Dr. Michael A. Scott, one of the most influential leaders and researchers in the field of isogeometric analysis, recently announced that he is leaving a tenured professorship at Brigham Young University to join Corefrom LLC full time as President. Dr. Scott, who co-founded Coreform in his research lab in 2014, has appeared on the Clarivate list of highly cited researchers every year since 2016 for his work on isogeometric analysis.

“Now is the right time to make this move,” Dr. Scott said. “Coreform has developed the world’s first native isogeometric analysis solver for general commercial use and is ready to move on to its next phase of growth. I’m looking forward to leading the team through this exciting time.”

Coreform was incorporated to develop isogeometric analysis, a form of computer simulation that is more efficient and accurate than traditional computer simulation approaches. Coreform IGA, its historic solver, was released in late 2022. Coreform CEO Matt Sederberg notes, “Dr. Michael Scott has been a driving innovator behind the success of Coreform since the very beginning. His research lab at BYU was the birthplace of many of our critical isogeometric analysis technologies. We have ambitious plans to mature our software into the next-generation standard for finite element analysis, and I am thrilled that he will lead this effort.”

Coreform has been the fastest growing computer-aided engineering company on the Inc. 5000 list every year since 2020. Dr. Scott joins Dr. Derek Thomas, Dr. Kevin Tew, and Dr. Michael Borden as co-founders and technical leaders at Coreform. Coreform co-founder Matt Sederberg continues as CEO.
