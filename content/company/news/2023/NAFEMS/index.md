The NAFEMS 2023 World Congress is being held this week in Tampa, FL. The Congress brings the global engineering simulation community together to create a cross-industry exchange of ideas, best practices, and information. Keynote speakers and presenters come from a range of industries and address the most urgent and salient topics for engineering simulation.

Coreform, represented by Chief Strategy Officer Matthew Sederberg and Director of Engineering Gregory Vernon, is in attendance. Our next-generation simulation technology allows users to get accurate results without cleaning, defeaturing, and meshing.

The conference includes representatives from FEA software developers, researchers, and users from around the world. The possibility of removing meshing from the simulation workflow is resonating with engineers in industries like automotive, defense, and additive manufacturing.
