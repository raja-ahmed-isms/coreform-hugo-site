    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, September 1, 2016 &mdash; csimsoft today released version 16.1 of its Trelis
        mesh generation software for Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis. The new release
        includes the new Smart Mesh Tool.</p>
    <p>Smart Meshing Tool. The new Smart Meshing Tool is a new Power Tool that allows the user to specify the meshing
        order that Trelis
        will use to mesh the model. By default, the Trelis auto scheme tries to all-hex mesh, then mix mesh, then
        tetmesh the model. Auto
        smoothing tries to shape poor elements.</p>
    <p>Additional features include;</p>
    <ul class="table-indent">
        <li>Improved mesh scaling</li>
        <li>Copy Mesh functionality improvements</li>
        <li>New IMPETUS export</li>
        <li>New Model Tree</li>
        <li>Rubber-band selection using a sphere tool</li>
        <li>Improved tri and tet mesher</li>
    </ul>
