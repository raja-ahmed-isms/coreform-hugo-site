    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, December 20, 2016 &mdash; csimsoft today announced the completion of an IMPETUS Afea solver
        exporter that supports Hex64 elements.
        The cubic elements can be limited to just the elements on the model boundary or throughout the model. The
        support for cubic elements allows
        IMPETUS to run a more precise analysis on model surfaces.</p>
    <p>"csimsoft is pleased to partner with CertaSIM to support the IMPETUS Afea solver. IMPETUS is an extremely
        accurate explicit dynamic solver," said Paul Ressler, csimsoft
        Director of Sales and Marketing. "We support HEX64 elements specifically for IMPETUS. Now, engineers can create
        meshes that can be solved with IMPETUS on a GPU in a
        fraction of the time it takes other solvers." </p>
