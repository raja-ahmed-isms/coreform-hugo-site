    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, February 1, 2016 &mdash; csimsoft today released its new Bolt automatic hexahedral
        mesh generation software for Computational Fluid Dynamics and Finite Element Analysis. Bolt is a
        push-button solution for generating all-hex meshes from complex, arbitrary geometries with little or
        no user interaction. It is an ideal meshing solution for simulations where the interface boundaries
        are represented as approximations, such as biomedical, metal forming, and geophysical; for simulation
        that requires minimal topology and feature capture; and for fast, iterative meshing for adaptive
        manufacturing and rapid prototyping.</p>
    <p>Bolt uses a grid overlay approach where a model is surrounded with a Cartesian grid and the geometry is
        extracted from the base mesh. Bolt stands apart from other grid-first approaches with new methods for
        node smoothing, resolving non-manifold conditions, and parallel mesh processing. "Probably the biggest
        difference between Bolt and other mesh-first approaches is the way Bolt handles the mesh layer between
        the interior mesh and the model boundary. The boundary mesh is where Bolt shines," said Paul Ressler,
        csimsoft's Director of Sales and Marketing. "Bolt's new approach to all-hex boundary meshing gives users
        a much better quality mesh where it really counts." Bolt's new volume fraction approach was designed
        specifically with material domains and parallel processing in mind.</p>
    <p>Most models can be meshed by simply clicking the Mesh button using the settings automatically calculated
        by Bolt. For greater control over the mesh, Bolt provides controls to adjust mesh type, desired cell
        size, and smoothing operations. Bolt imports a variety of facet models, including .STL, that are
        generated from a user's CAD package. </p>
