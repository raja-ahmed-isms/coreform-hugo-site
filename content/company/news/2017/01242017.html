        <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, January 24, 2017 &mdash; csimsoft, a leading developer of simulation tools for
                computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis, today announced the general release of Bolt
                version 1.2.</p>
        <p>The Bolt release includes enhancements to the boundary-meshing algorithm, improved adaptive mesh refinement,
                and improvements to the user experience, including the addition of context menus, hotkeys, and new
                meshing options. A new Beta tab includes several beta features that users can use and provide feedback.
        </p>
        <p>"This Bolt release improves both the user experience and the quality of the mesh," said Paul Ressler,
                csimsoft Director of Sales and Marketing. "User now have access to shortcuts and menus that make using
                Bolt easier. The real significant improvements are to the meshing core, allowing users to mesh difficult
                model with better quality."</p>
        <p>Bolt uses a grid-overlay method for meshing STL and other facet models. Bolt removes mesh elements that lie
                outside the model and uses a sophisticated approach to generate high-quality mesh elements at the
                boundary.</p>
