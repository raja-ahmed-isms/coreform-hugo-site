<p>Matt Lombard's Dezignstuff blog was the epicenter of conversations and opinions about CAD software and surfacing earlier this decade. Siemens hired Matt several years ago and the blog died down; he's recently independent again and we're happy to see that he has started to write again.</p>
 
<p>In his first interview since restarting his blog, he&nbsp;<a href="https://dezignstuff.com/matt-sederberg-introduces-coreform-and-usplines/">interviewed Coreform CEO Matt Sederberg</a> about his past with T-Splines and what Coreform is doing to commercialize isogeometric analysis and U-splines.</p>
