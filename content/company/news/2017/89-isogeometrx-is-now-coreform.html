    <p>When we founded Isogeometrx in 2014, it was in response to growing industry demand for commercial isogeomteric
        analysis tools. IGA had been invented back in 2005, and yet no commercial companies had emerged to champion its
        adoption within industry.</p>

    <p>The past three years has seen our company evolve from an extension of a research group to a growing product
        company. We picked the new name Coreform in part because we were tired of explaining how to spell �Isogeometrx.�
        But also, after debating over 200 names between us, Coreform stood apart with both the strength of the name and
        the connotations it provided: truly, our mission is to enable better simulation through better geometry, and
        this is only possible by enhancing the core basis of the forms being simulated.</p>
