        <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, January 17, 2017 &mdash; csimsoft, a leading developer of simulation tools for
                computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis, today announced the release of Trelis 16.2.
                The latest version includes improvements to its meshing algorithms, graphical user interface, and
                exporters.</p>
        <p>Meshing improvements to the tetmesher include new boundary recovery algorithms that increase the success of
                generating a tetrahedral mesh of complex geometries. A new deactivation option allows user to deactivate
                the Trelis license and moving the license to another computer. The IMPETUS export has been enhanced to
                export HEX64 elements and to specify whether all the elements are cubic or whether only the hexes on the
                outer boundary of the model will be cubic.</p>
        <p>"Trelis continues to be the meshing tool of choice for high-quality meshing," said Paul Ressler, csimsoft
                Director of Sales and Marketing. "This latest version includes significant improvements to the Trelis
                core that make both hex and tet meshing even better."</p>
