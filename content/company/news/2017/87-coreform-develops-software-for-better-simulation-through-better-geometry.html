    <p>At Coreform, we've been working for a few years (we previously called our company Isogeometrx) on laying the
        foundation for the commercial use of isogeometric analysis (IGA). IGA has been well-proven academically as an
        accurate and exciting field of finite element analysis (FEA).</p>

    <p>IGA is sometimes called "next-gen" FEA because of its promise of higher accuracy and unification with CAD
        geometry. But IGA has lacked enabling technology to be seriously used in industry. And, while anyone associated
        with the CAD or CAE industries would agree at a high level that significant efficiencies would be gained if FEA
        was able to be performed directly on CAD geometry without first simplifying, approximating, and meshing the CAD,
        such a vision would require massive, fundamental change.</p>
    <p>A path towards this unification of CAD and FEA is emerging from our work at Coreform. We're working on a first
        commercial step of bringing the accuracy benefits of IGA to existing FEA workflows. We've invented an enabling
        technology, U-splines, that has shown promising early results as a basis for improved simulation as well as
        potential for use in CAD. We will be publicly unveiling U-splines later this year. In the meantime, it's time to
        start talking more about what we're up to and the power of IGA. Check out our website to learn more, including:

    <p>We acknowledge and thank our strong foundation of commercial and government partners who are funding our
        development. If you need higher accuracy in your simulations than you�re currently getting from FEA, or tighter
        integration between CAD and CAE, and would like us to consider your requirements as we continue
        development,&nbsp;<a href="https://coreform.com/company/contact">let�s talk</a>!</p>
    <p>Finally, please sign up for our newsletter (link on the bottom of any page of&nbsp;<a
            href="https://coreform.com/">our website</a>) to stay in touch. We�re still several months out from
        having beta software available, and we want to keep you informed as the journey continues.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Matt Sederberg<br>Co-founder and CEO, Coreform LLC</p>
