    <p>OREM, UTAH, February 25, 2020 &mdash; Coreform LLC, the leading developer of commercial spline-based simulation software, announced today the release of its Coreform Trelis 17.0 advanced meshing software for generating high-quality meshes for FEA and CFD simulations. The new version includes many significant features and enhancements, including methods for parallel hexahedral meshing in the professional version.</p>

    <p>The new version of Coreform Trelis Pro includes the all-hex Sculpt mesh method previously available in Bolt from csimsoft. The  multi-threaded Sculpt method uses an immersed method that overlays a Cartesian grid on a model to create a mesh. All versions of Coreform Trelis includes updated Python support, improved auto mesh scheme and interval assignment, and an updated geometry kernel with improved geometry creation and cleanup.</p>
    
    <p>The new features and many enhancements make Coreform Trelis one of the most robust meshing tools available for CAE. "Trelis continues to be the go-to meshing tool when other tools fall short in creating a high-quality mesh," said Paul Ressler, Director of Sales and Marketing at Coreform. "Trelis is a proven mesher and plays an important role in Coreform's development strategy as we respond to our customers' need for high-end simulation solutions."</p>

    <p>Coreform acquired Trelis software through the strategic acquisition of Computational Simulation Software, LLC (dba csimsoft) earlier this year to gain additional commercial software development expertise and to integrate the Trelis preprocessor with its patented U-spline technology to create the world's first commercial smooth spline-based simulation workflow.</p>
