	<p>OREM, UTAH, November 22, 2019 &mdash; Coreform LLC, a leading developer of commercial spline-based simulation software, is pleased to announce that two of its senior advisors, Dr. Thomas J.R. Hughes and Dr. Michael Scott, have been named among the most influential scientists in the world according to the 2019 Highly Cited Researcher list published by Clarivate Analytics (formerly Thomson Reuters).</p>

	<p>Clarivate Analytics publishes an annual list recognizing researchers in the sciences and social sciences who have produced multiple papers ranking in the top one percent by citations for their field. "We congratulate Dr. Hughes and Dr. Scott on this prestigious recognition. Dr. Hughes is the father of the field of isogeometric analysis. Dr. Scott is leading very innovative spline-based simulation research to drive the commercial adoption of isogeometric analysis," said Matthew Sederberg, CEO at Coreform. "Their contributions will change the way engineers do high-end simulations in the future."</p>

	<p>Dr. Hughes is professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics, holder of the Peter O'Donnell, Jr. Chair in Computational and Applied Mathematics, and leader of the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/people/339/">Oden Institute Computational Mechanics Group</a> at The University of Texas at Austin. He is the creator of Isogeometric Analysis and his original paper on this subject, published October 1, 2005, is the most cited and downloaded paper published in the international journal Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering in the last fourteen years. His research group at UT Austin has been one of the most active in the world in Isogeometric Analysis, and other areas of Computational Mechanics.</p>

	<p>Dr. Scott is an Associate Professor in the <a href="http://isogeometric.et.byu.edu/">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at Brigham Young University and head of the computational geometry and mechanics group. His research interests lie at the intersection of computational geometry, mechanics, and relevant engineering applications. Dr. Scott co-founded Coreform LLC in 2014.</p>
