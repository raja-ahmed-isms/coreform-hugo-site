Coreform has landed on the Inc. 5000 list of top-growing companies, ranking an incredible #594 nationwide!

This is our first appearance on the Inc. 5000 list, and we are beyond proud and delighted to be recognized for
our hard work and incredible growth.

Our company is still small, but our growth potential is enormous. This year we have worked closely with a number
of companies who see the potential for U-spline technology and IGA development. These corporate partners have 
enabled us to continue developing our next-generation code while still supporting our best-in-class mesher, 
Coreform Cubit. As our software matures, we expect to continue growing and serving our customers.

We also note that our home state of Utah was well-represented on the list. For the fifth year in a row, Utah
fielded more than 100 companies in the top 5000. That may not seem like much, but itâ€™s twice as many appearances 
than you would expect based on population. (Utah has .8% of the US population but fielded 2.3% of the ranked 
companies.)  [See all the results here](https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2020).

This is just the beginning. This year will see another major upgrade to Coreform Cubit, website improvements, and
better-than-ever customer support. Meanwhile, we literally can't do this without you, so if you have any suggestions, questions, or need anything
at all, please reach out to us on the [forum](https://forum.coreform.com) or email [support@coreform.com](mailto:support@coreform.com).
