Announcing our new webinar series, designed to guide you through everything you need to know to get the most out of Coreform Cubit.

### Tutorial webinar series info

The first session will be held **December 10th 2020**, and [you can sign up here](https://coreform.com/support/webinars/). This webinar will cover Coreform Cubit basics - using tools, preparing a hex mesh, and common problems to avoid. It will run about an hour and will cover everything you need to know to get started with Coreform Cubit. The full outline is listed below.

This webinar will be conducted by our own **Randy Morris**, part of the csimsoft team that developed Cubit in partnership with Sandia National Laboratories. He's not only a Coreform Cubit expert, but also a delightful instructor. You won't want to miss seeing him in action.

The live webinar will be the perfect place to ask questions and get insights directly from Mr. Morris. But if you can't make it at 10am for the live webinar, rest assured it will be available for viewing later.
