**Coreform Trelis is now Coreform Cubit!**

To celebrate, we created this fun video. Seriously, watch it. This is the most fun you'll have in computer-aided engineering today.

We have had a great run with Trelis, the commercial version of the high-quality Cubit software developed at Sandia National Laboratories. But we have always loved the Cubit brand, and as part of our new [exclusive licensing agreement](https://coreform.com/company/news/2020/exclusive/) with Sandia, we secured the rights to it. Coreform will continue its joint relationship with Sandia to help develop Cubit, and the new Coreform Cubit brand reflects the closer strategic alignment and coordination we anticipate going forward.

### What does this mean for you?

Nothing but goodness. It means we are doubling down on our commitment to Trelis (now Coreform Cubit) and investing in its improvement. It also means we're simplifying our product family:

* All new licenses sold will be simply Coreform Cubit, without different flavors for FEA or CFD. All Pro features will now be available to all users.
* All Trelis Pro, Trelis FEA, and Trelis CFD licenses will automatically convert over to Coreform Cubit licenses for the remainder of their term. We are introducing new pricing for Coreform Cubit, but don't worry - all existing licenses will renew at their grandfathered price. 
* All active Trelis academic licenses will convert to full Coreform Cubit licenses for the remainder of their term.  Afterwards, they are eligible for the free Coreform Cubit Learn edition, the university partnership license, or full Coreform Cubit commercial licenses.

### Free for students!

Yes, you read that right. The new Coreform Cubit is available for free for limited non-commercial use. All the features you know and love are included (even the ones that used to be reserved for Pro users), subject to non-commercial use and a 50,000 element export limit.

### Coreform Cubit 2020.2: now available!

As part of this rebrand, Coreform Cubit will switch to a year-based version number: the release that would have been Coreform Trelis 17.2 is instead Coreform Cubit 2020.2. 

### Rediscover the Coreform Cubit community

At Coreform, we've always been passionate about meshing and simulation. But we didn't realize how much we had to say about it until we went fully remote during COVID, and suddenly our internal board has been lit up with all sorts of lively discussions. We'd like to invite you to join us. We are transitioning our dialogue onto our public online forum, <a href="https://forum.coreform.com">forum.coreform.com</a>. Please visit and engage in our discussisons about meshing, simulations, and isogeoemtric analysis. 

 We are also launching a series of webinars! We'll talk about meshing and isogeometric analysis and everything in between. The series will feature Coreformers, Sandians, and some of our users. We're really excited and can't wait to see you there. Sign up for the first one, <a href="/support/webinars/">"Introduction to Coreform Cubit"</a>, by long-time Cubit developer and Coreform COO Randy Morris.


Meanwhile, we literally can't do this without you, so if you have any suggestions, questions, or need anything 
at all, please reach out to us on the <a href="https://forum.coreform.com">forum</a> or email <a href="mailto:support@coreform.com">support@coreform.com</a>.
