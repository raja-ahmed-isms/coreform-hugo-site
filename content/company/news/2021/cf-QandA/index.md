In this webinar, Coreform Cubit expert Greg Vernon will respond live to questions from the Coreform Cubit forum. In advance of the webinar, users are invited to post their Cubit-related questions on the Coreform Cubit forum, and voice their support for the questions they are most interested in seeing answered live. During the webinar, Greg will answer and demonstrate solutions for as many questions as can fit inside 50 minutes.

This event is geared toward those who have some familiarity with Coreform Cubit, but everyone is welcome to attend. A question and answer session will follow the webinar.
