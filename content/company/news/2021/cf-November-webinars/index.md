The first webinar, IGA model preparation in Coreform Cubit, will be hosted at 9:00 AM (MT) November 18, 2021. Coreform Director of Product Development Greg Vernon will show how to create U-spline IGA models in Coreform Cubit and prepare them for simulation in IGA-enabled solvers such as LS-DYNA and Coreform IGA. Additionally, he will show how to use U-splines to generate smooth, geometry-compliant lattice structures for 3D printing and slicing.
