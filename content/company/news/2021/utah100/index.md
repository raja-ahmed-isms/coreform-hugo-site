MountainWest Capital Network (MWCN) announced its 2021 winners at an event on October 12th, and Orem-based Coreform ranked #22, the highest-ranking computer-aided engineering (CAE) software company in Utah. The Utah 100 Companies are ranked according to a weighted average calculation of percentage and dollar growth over a five-year period.

“We are proud to be recognized for our hard work in developing next-generation engineering simulation technology,” said Matthew Sederberg, CEO of Coreform. “Our team has embraced the challenges of the Covid era and has continued to grow and innovate.”

Earlier this year, Coreform was also recognized as one of the top fastest-growing companies in the United States by Inc. 5000. Coreform ranked #699 overall nationwide, and was the top CAE company. 

Coreform software accelerates product development by enabling engineers to predict real-world behavior with higher accuracy, faster solution time, and faster model preparation than traditional finite element analysis. “None of this happens in a vacuum,” adds Michael A. Scott, Associate Professor of Engineering at BYU and President of Coreform. “We appreciate the efforts of the state of Utah and the MWCN to foster a great environment for business growth.” 

"Utah has led the nation in economic growth for several years, and Salt Lake City has historically been the epicenter with occasional standout companies located elsewhere," notes Dave Chase, MWCN managing partner. "But we are now finding growth from many areas across the state. Nine of our top 10 companies are from Utah County or south Salt Lake County. This trend is promising for sustaining our state's economic powerhouse."

MWCN is Utah's first and largest business networking organization devoted to supporting entrepreneurial success and dedicated to the flow of financial, entrepreneurial and intellectual capital. Learn more at www.mwcn.org.
