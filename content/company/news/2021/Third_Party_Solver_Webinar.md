Coreform’s free webinar series continues with this fascinating look into using Coreform Cubit as a front-end with a third-party solver. Dr. Anatoly Vershinin, the CTO of CAE-Fidesys and an associate professor at Lomonosov Moscow State University, will demonstrate how Cubit works effectively with Fidesys.

You actually get a double dose of information with this webinar, because Dr. Vershinin will also show how to use Coreform Cubit to mesh some of the complex models used in geophysics and geomechanics.

Coreform Cubit’s highly customizable user interface makes it easy to use it with third-party software. And its advanced meshing solutions make it ideal for the difficult and challenging 3D models used in geophysics applications. 

See our [previous webinars]( https://coreform.com/support/webinars/) for some of Coreform Cubit's most useful features and how to use them.
