This webinar is developed for newer Coreform Cubit users and is ideal for students, but anyone is welcome to join.

“Hex meshing with Coreform Cubit” will cover some advanced techniques for creating high quality hex meshes in Cubit. We will briefly discuss why you may want a hexahedral mesh instead of a tetrahedral mesh and show meshing techniques on single part.
