Coreformâ€™s free webinar series continues with this long-awaited look into Coreform Cubit's Python API. 

In this webinar, Cubit expert Gregory Vernon will demonstrate how to use Coreform Cubit's Python API to extend and maximize the power of Cubit. The Cubit/Python integration is one of the key features that makes Coreform Cubit the most adaptive and powerful meshing tool for complex models and demanding simulations. It allows users to add  their own meshing algorithms and the automations they need for their own applications.

Learn how to extend the functionality of Coreform Cubit, automate workflows, and deploy your models with Python scripting in this free hourlong webinar. Attend live to take advantage of interactive Q&A.

## Webinar details:

In this webinar we will show how to use Coreform Cubit's powerful Python API to extend the functionality of Coreform Cubit. We will show you how to:
 
- Access the broad Python ecosystem in order to develop unique solutions for your meshing and model-building challenges.
- Automate your critical workflows and integrate your solutions into the Coreform Cubit GUI for ease-of-access. 
- Incorporate Coreform Cubit into your existing Python-based simulation workflows by importing Coreform Cubit as a Python module.

### Webinar outline (subject to change):
