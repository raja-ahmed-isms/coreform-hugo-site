On **Tuesday, January 12th at 10am**, Cubit expert **Kurtis Ford** from Sandia National Laboratories will demonstrate how to use the powerful new Sculpt tool and answer your questions about everything Cubit.

At this webinar, Mr. Ford will demonstrate how Cubit can be used to generate a high quality hex mesh on a complex 3d geometry (see below) generated from a fluid mechanics model of a material melt process. The physics-based morphology is conformally meshed with hexes so that the thermal history from the fluid run can be used in a linear Lagrange code to perform a viscoplastic calculation. This geometry is impossible to mesh without Sculpt, a tool in Sandia Cubit that will be available to Coreform Cubit users by January 12th.

### Kurtis Ford Q&A

In the live webinar, Mr. Ford will be available to answer your questions about how he has used Cubit in production for over a decade. Although the event will be recorded and available for later viewing, you won't want to miss the opportunity to interact with one of the world's foremost experts in Cubit meshing. 

**Host bio:** Kurtis Ford is a solid mechanics analyst from Sandia National Laboratories who received both his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Utah in 2011. His research interests have included: the imperfection sensitivity of buckling, highly flexible beams, fracture in thin coatings, mechanical modeling of welds, additive manufacturing, Weibull analysis on complex stress fields, coupled multiphysics modeling, digital twin, smart materials and nonlinear viscoelasticity of epoxy thermosets and inorganic glass.
