This IGA conference is the best place to learn about the latest advances in many fields of IGA from the leading researchers in this large community, where over 3400 papers have been published since 2005. Sessions focused on fluid-structure interaction, immersed methods, biomedical applications, solids and structures, industrial applications of IGA, and more will be available.
