Coreform's webinar series will feature an isogeometric analysis (IGA) event on **Tuesday, February 9th at 10am.** This free online instructional class is available to anyone, at all levels of interest in CAE and IGA.

In this event, Gregory Vernon will lead participants through an exploration of isogeometric analysis (IGA) based on Coreform's unique spline technologies. IGA is generally recognized as a finite element method that uses smooth splines instead of traditional elements. Mr. Vernon will demystify IGA, walking you through what it is and what it is not, and describing how splines fit into the IGA/FEA discussion. He will also cover Coreform’s unique approach to realizing the benefits of IGA and the mathematical foundations involved.

Mr. Vernon will also be available for Q&A about the state of the art in isogeometric analysis and Coreform IGA.

Some initial spline functionality will be added to Coreform Cubit during 2021, with more capabilities to be added over the next couple of years as Coreform IGA matures. You don’t want to miss this one --- it’s going to be a game-changer.
