Coreform is offering a free webinar on **January 13, 2022 (9 am MST)** to demonstrate how to use Coreform Cubit and Python scripting to set up and run a refinement study. These techniques are applicable to any solver; guest presenter Klaus Robbert will demonstrate using the open-source, multi-physics solver openCFS. 

Coreform Cubit is used by dozens of open-source and home-grown solvers for simulation model preprocessing and meshing, and Coreform supports these partners by promoting their solutions to the broader Coreform community.

openCFS is growing in popularity worldwide from its origins in Central Europe, especially among the academic community. openCFS natively supports coupled physics and allows for non-conforming meshes to streamline data preparation. openCFS relies on Coreform Cubit for geometry preparation, meshing, and preprocessing.
