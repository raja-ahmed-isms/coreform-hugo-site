Coreform LLC, the fastest-growing computer-aided engineering company on the Inc. 5000 2021, is releasing historic new technology in their latest version of [Coreform Cubit](/products/coreform-cubit/). With the newest release, Coreform Cubit users can use U-spline isogeometric analysis (IGA) modeling technology in their engineering workflows. This is a significant addition to Coreform Cubit’s suite of advanced meshing tools for challenging simulations.

“It’s gratifying for us to put U-spline technology in the hands of our users,” says Coreform CEO Matthew Sederberg. “We’ve worked for this moment for years, and we have even more exciting developments planned for the future.”

The new IGA technology is compatible with existing IGA-enabled solvers such as LS-DYNA and [Coreform IGA](/products/coreform-iga/). The U-splines capability in the new release of Coreform Cubit is also leveraged in a new separately priced module called Coreform Lattice GC, fully-embedded in Coreform Cubit for high-quality  lattice generation and slicing for 3D printing.

“Coreform Lattice GC is powerful and unique,” notes Gregory Vernon, Director of Product Development at Coreform. “Its smooth connected elements that flow with a part's geometry lead to improved performance, and our integrated solution within Coreform Cubit's familiar meshing interface provides immediate improvement to our customers’ workflows.”

A free trial of the software is available at [www.coreform.com](/products/trial/).
