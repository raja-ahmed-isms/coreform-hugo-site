On Tuesday, May 12th at 10am MDT, Coreform Director of Product Management Greg Vernon will demonstrate how Coreform’s isogeometric analysis solver, Coreform IGA, can predict failure onset of a mechanical part. He will demonstrate model preparation and meshing in Coreform Cubit, then show how the technology within Coreform IGA allows us to drastically reduce the overall time to solution by largely eliminating the challenges with meshing complex geometries. All this, while still maintaining a high-accuracy solution. 

Commercial isogeometric analysis is still in its infancy, but the potential for greatly improved speed and accuracy with isogeometric approaches is significant. This is your chance to see how IGA technology can improve workflows and to stay up-to-date with the future of CAE. Attend live to take advantage of interactive Q&A.
