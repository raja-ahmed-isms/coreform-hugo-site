On Friday, June 18th at 10am MDT, Coreform Director of Product Management Greg Vernon will introduce how the Coreform Cubit meshing software can generate high quality meshes for engineering simulation to accelerate your product development and reduce costs. In the webinar, we will demonstrate how to use Coreform Cubit to prepare various types of meshes, including 2D triangular and quadrilateral meshes, and 3D tetrahedral/hexahedral/mixed meshes. Additionally, we will introduce Coreform Cubitâ€™s simulation preprocessing capabilities, including how to make material assignments and assign boundary & load conditions to prepare models for simulation.

Coreform Cubit is a premier meshing software whose advanced tools can help you reduce the costs of physical prototyping and testing. Our pre-processing capabilities allow users to minimize time spent on model preparation for FEA and CFD, while maximizing control over mesh quality. This webinar will help new users get started learning how to get the most out of Coreform Cubit.
