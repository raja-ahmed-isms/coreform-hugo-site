    <p>OREM, UTAH, October 23, 2019 &mdash; Coreform LLC, a leading developer of commercial spline-based simulation
        software, announced today the acquisition of Computational Simulation Software, LLC (dba "csimsoft"), the
        developer of the high-end mesh generation tool, Trelis, and co-developer of Sandia National Laboratories'
        widely-used CUBIT meshing software. The addition of csimsoft's robust, high-end mesh generation technology
        provides Coreform customers with the first complete workflow for using spline-based FEA technology.</p>
    <p>csimsoft provides advanced meshing for challenging simulations enabling a reduction in the simulation bottleneck
        of generating an appropriate mesh. Engineers in a broad range of industries rely on csimsoft's meshing expertise
        for generating meshes for difficult engineering simulations. csimsoft's team has been instrumental in the
        development and enhancement of meshing approaches and algorithms now used in simulation throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>Coreform leverages more than a decade of research in the field of isogeometric analysis to develop its
        spline-based simulation software, currently in beta. The acquisition of csimsoft enables Coreform to provide
        effective and efficient mesh generation and spline-based simulation for fast and accurate analysis of advanced
        simulation problems. The addition of the csimsoft technology, expertise and people enable Coreform to accelerate
        the commercialization of its spline-based simulation software.</p>
    <p>"Coreform's U-spline technology propels isogeometric analysis past traditional finite element analysis in its
        ability to give simulation engineers extremely accurate results without the high cost of time and computational
        resources. Its spline-based simulation approach is the only viable solution for many engineering problems," said
        Randy Morris, csimsoft Managing Director. "Simulation using analysis-suitable spline geometry is how engineers
        will solve problems in the future."</p>
    <p>"We are pleased to continue our long and close association with the csimsoft team as part of Coreform," said
        Matthew Sederberg, CEO at Coreform. "Their software development and meshing expertise will enhance Coreform's
        ability to deliver next-generation simulation solutions for the challenging engineering problems that can't
        currently be solved using traditional FEA."</p>
