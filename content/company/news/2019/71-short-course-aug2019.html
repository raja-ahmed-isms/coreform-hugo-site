<p>A new highly accurate and performant approach to FEA is to run simulations directly on smooth splines, the building blocks of CAD models. Thousands of academic papers have been published since 2005 investigating this approach. Coreform LLC was formed in 2014 to be 100% focused on commercializing smooth-spline based simulation, and has invented a new unstructured spline type to enable commercial applications. We are also writing Coreform Analyze (beta), a commercial solver natively built to run on a smooth spline basis. In all of these efforts, we are focused on delivering better accuracy in less time, increased robustness, and lower simulation costs, and we are focused on requiring minimal change to commercial workflows.</p>
 
<p>As commercial interest in smooth spline-based simulation grows, there is increasing demand by early adopters to understand the fundamentals of this type of simulation, and how it compares with traditional finite element analysis. The objective of this two-day short course on August 21-22, 2019, is to provide a foundation of smooth spline-based simulation theory and applications. Applicants will understand the current state of the art, along with limitations. This course will be unique from other academically focused short courses in the fields of spline-based simulation and isogeometric analysis (IGA) because of its mixture of theory with hands-on application using our Coreform Process preprocessor and Coreform Analyze solver.</p>
<h2>Course outline (subject to change):</h2>
<h3>Day 1: basic theory and analysis-suitable geometry</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overview of splines in CAD and FEA</li>
<li>BÃ©zier extraction, projection, and adaptivity</li>
<li>An introduction to U-splines</li>
<li>Fundamentals of spline-based simulation and isogeometric analysis</li>
<li>Isogeometric finite element formulations</li>
<li>Applications in structural analysis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Day 2: applications</h3>
<p>Application-specific theory and hands-on exercises with the Coreform Process preprocessor and Coreform Analyze smooth-spline solver, including</p>
<ul>
<li>NAFEMS benchmarks</li>
<li>Contact</li>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Non-manifold shell problems</li>
</ul>
<p>At the conclusion of the training, participants will receive extended online access to Coreform Process to continue to have access to the simulations they ran during the short course and to continue to run their own simulation problems.</p>
