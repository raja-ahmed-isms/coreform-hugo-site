<p>A new highly accurate and performant approach to FEA is to run simulations directly on smooth splines, the building blocks of CAD models. Thousands of academic papers have been published since 2005 investigating this approach. Coreform LLC was formed in 2014 and is 100% focused on commercializing spline-based simulation. We have invented a new unstructured spline type to enable commercial applications. We are also writing Coreform Analyze (beta), a commercial solver natively built to run on a smooth spline basis. In all of these efforts, we are focused on delivering better accuracy in less time, increased robustness, and lower simulation costs, and we are focused on requiring minimal change to commercial workflows.</p>

<p>As commercial interest in smooth spline-based simulation grows, there is increasing demand by early adopters to understand the fundamentals of this type of simulation, and how it compares with traditional finite element analysis. The objective of this two-day short course is to provide a foundation of smooth spline-based simulation theory and applications. Applicants will understand the current state of the art, along with limitations. This course will be unique from other academically focused short courses in the fields of spline-based simulation and isogeometric analysis (IGA) because of its mixture of theory with hands-on application using our Coreform Process preprocessor and Coreform Analyze solver.</p>
