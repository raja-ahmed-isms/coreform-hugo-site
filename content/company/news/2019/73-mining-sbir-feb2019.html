<p>SILICON SLOPES, UT,  7 February 2019 &mdash; Coreform LLC was awarded today a new Phase I SBIR from the United States Department of Energy to advance the commercialization of its groundbreaking isogeometric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) technologies.</p>
<p>This funding program is highly competitive, and submissions are vetted for both technical promise and business potential. Coreform was granted this contract based on the promise of its isogeometric analysis technologies, including its patent-pending U-spline technology, and the strength of its experienced leadership team. This contract will advance certain fundamental aspects of the U-spline technology and also investigate applications of U-splines to the mining industry.</p>
<p>ï¿½Isogeometric analysis promises to increase the value of simulation across a number of industries, including both traditional and emerging markets. We're grateful for the support of the Department of Energy in our efforts to open doors to new workflows, significant time savings, and higher accuracy," said Matthew Sederberg, Coreform CEO. "This contract will build on a strong foundation of public and private partners funding the development of sofware based on Coreform's commercial isogeometric analysis technology."</p>
<p>Coreform is actively hiring additional researchers and programmers to join its team and create the first native isogeometric analysis software, which promises higher accuracy and time savings over traditional FEA techniques. Please visit the Coreform careers page to learn more.</p>
