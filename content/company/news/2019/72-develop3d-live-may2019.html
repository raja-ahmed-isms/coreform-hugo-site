Presenting alongside senior leaders from Ansys, SolidWorks, OnShape, Altair, Autodesk, PTC, and others at this premier industry event, Coreform CEO Matt Sederberg shared Coreform's advances in highly accurate smooth spline-based simulation software.</p>
 
<p>He also gave the first glimpses into Coreform Process and Coreform Analyze, the preprocessor and solver, respectively, that Coreform is developing based on smooth splines. A recording of the presentation is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://develop3dlive.com/">recorded livestream from Develop3D Live</a>. His talk begins at the 4:20:00 mark.&nbsp;In the presentation, Matt shares examples of how simulation based on smooth splines promises better accuracy in less time, increased robustness, lower simulation costs, and minimal change to workflows.</p>
