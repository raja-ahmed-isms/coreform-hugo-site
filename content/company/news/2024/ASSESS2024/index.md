From NAFEMS: Top-level figures in industry, government, and academia will come together for this interactive leadership summit in Atlanta, Georgia, between March 4th and 6th 2024. This opportunity for leaders in engineering analysis and simulation to come together will guide and shape the direction of the industry for years to come.

N​o other meeting brings top-level thought-leaders together to discuss the real issues in industry, and look at the bigger picture. You'll find key players from the consulting world, cutting-edge software development, global industrial users, government agencies, and elite academia. The community of model-based analysis, simulation and systems engineering looks to NAFEMS through initiatives like ASSESS to lead the industry toward the future - and the ASSESS Summit will deliver that guidance.

Places at the Summit are limited. The meeting will cover all of the main ASSESS Themes during interactive workshops, reporting findings and recommendations to the plenary and, ultimately, the simulation world.
