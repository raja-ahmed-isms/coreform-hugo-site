The US Department of Energy has announced Coreform’s receipt of a competitive SBIR grant to improve modern car manufacturing. The funded project will develop software to allow engineering simulation of auto parts manufactured with modern Giga casting techniques. 

Giga-casting refers to using a large aluminum die-casts part to replace complicated sheet-metal assemblies composed of dozens of individual parts. The process of giga-casting saves automotive manufacturers significant time and money, but existing engineering simulation software is unable to handle crash simulation for cars with giga-cast parts. Coreform’s proprietary isogeometric analysis software has the potential to solve this problem and allow for crash simulation of giga-cast parts. 

Potential benefits of this project include improved automotive safety, accelerated time to market for new automobiles, and improved energy efficiency through lighter-weight cars. The developed technology will also help safer products get to market faster across other industries including aerospace, nuclear energy, and defense.
