    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, January 15, 2015 &mdash; csimsoft, a leading developer of simulation tools for the 
        CFD and FEA communities, announced today that its mesh generation software, Trelis, is part of the 
        SimulationForDesign 
        website. The website was created by Fidesys, LLC to enable designers without simulation background 
        to reliably evaluate structural performance (displacements and stresses) of design alternatives and 
        make performance based design decisions early in the development cycle.</p>
    <p>A key feature in the SimulationForDesign process is the robust automatic model meshing using csimsoft's 
        Trelis software. The mesh is then used for strength analysis with the commercially proven Fidesys solver. 
        "SimulationForDesign gives designers a quick and affordable way to test and compare design options for 
        structural performance before committing to a specific design. The process therefore significantly 
        reduces the development cycle," said Randy Morris, csimsoft's managing director. "csimsoft's high-end 
        meshing and Fidesys's FEM solver are a powerful combination."</p>
    <p>The analysis is done using Fidesys Online, Fidesys LLC's linear static structural solver embedded in an 
        easy-to-use environment planned with consideration for the needs of designers, not simulation specialists. 
        SimulationForDesign is accessible through standard browsers and does not require installation of any 
        application on the designer's workstation.</p>
    <p>Trelis is based on time-proven technology developed for more than two decades in conjunction with Sandia 
        National Laboratories. Trelis also includes MeshGems<span class="symbolfont">&trade;</span> Pre-CAD, CADSurf, and Tetra from Distene, 
        the recognized world leader in triangle and tetrahedral meshing technologies. The combination of all 
        three of these components provides our users with the best possible triangle and tetrahedral meshing solution.</p>
