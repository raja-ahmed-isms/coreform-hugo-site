    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, January 12, 2015 &mdash; csimsoft, a leading developer of simulation
        pre-processing tools for CFD and FEA, announced today the release of the Trelis<span
            class="symbolfont">&trade;</span>
        SpaceClaim<span class="symbolfont">&trade;</span> Add-in, a mesh generation add-in for the popular ANSYS&reg;
        SpaceClaim 3D
        modeling software that allows designers to quickly create new designs and automatically mesh
        their design iterations for FEA and CFD analysis.</p>
    <p>The SpaceClaim add-in includes Trelis Lite<span class="symbolfont">&trade;</span> 15.1, a lite version of
        csimsoft's popular
        Trelis geometry preparation and mesh generation software. Trelis Lite produces high-quality
        triangle and tetrahedral meshes using MeshGems<span class="symbolfont">&trade;</span> from Distene, the
        recognized world leader
        in triangle and tetrahedral meshing technologies. Trelis Lite contains support for assessing
        mesh quality and establishing boundary conditions, material properties, and other parameters
        necessary for analysis. The mesh can be exported for analysis in various solver formats.</p>
    <p>Trelis is based on time-proven technology developed for more than two decades in conjunction
        with Sandia National Laboratories. Trelis provides users with powerful meshing tools that
        specifically meet their pre-processing needs through robust geometry preparation and high-quality
        mesh generation for FEA and CFD analysis.</p>
