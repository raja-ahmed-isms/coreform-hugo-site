    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, <i>January 4, 2013</i> &mdash; csimsoft, a leading developer
        of pre-processing tools for CFD and FEA professionals, announced the release
        of Trelis 14.0, the next generation of its advanced meshing tools. Trelis 14.0
        is available in three versions, Trelis FEA<span class="symbolfont">&trade;</span>, Trelis CFD<span
            class="symbolfont">&trade;</span>, and
        Trelis Pro<span class="symbolfont">&trade;</span>. Trelis 14.0 is based on the time-proven CUBIT<span
            class="symbolfont">&trade;</span> code
        that has been developed for more than two decades in conjunction with Sandia
        National Laboratories.</p>
    <p>Trelis delivers powerful meshing tools with features that specifically meet
        the needs of csimsoft's rapidly growing worldwide commercial user base. "Trelis
        is the result of more than two decades of developing the CUBIT code for meshing
        complex models," says Randy Morris, csimsoft Managing Director. "In the past,
        CUBIT had to meet the high demands of Sandia National Laboratories. Now we're
        focusing on the high-end meshing needs of our commercial customers."</p>
    <p>In addition to its ability to generate hexahedral and tetrahedral meshes for
        large volume assemblies, Trelis 14.0 improves the robust Power Tools and the
        popular ITEM wizard previously found in CUBIT. Other features include CFD tools
        for boundary layer meshing, CFD boundary conditions, and improved hybrid meshing;
        improved support for ANSYS, Fluent, and GAMBIT formats; and improved interval
        sizing. "These improvements give users better diagnostic and validation tools for
        ensuring meshable geometry and quality meshes," says Karl Merkley, Director of
        R&D. "With the improved CFD features, Trelis CFD is a must-have tool for CFD
        professionals."</p>
