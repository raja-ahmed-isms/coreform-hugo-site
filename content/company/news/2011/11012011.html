    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, <i>November 1, 2011</i> &mdash; Computational Simulation 
        Software, LLC (csimsoft) is pleased to announce that Paul Ressler has joined 
        the company as the director of sales and marketing. Ressler combines his 
        experience with developing
        successful marketing strategies with past experience as a business owner to 
        position csimsoft for continued future growth.</p>
    <p>"csimsoft is experiencing tremendous growth," said Randy Morris, csimsoft's 
        managing director. "Mr. Ressler's marketing expertise and strategic vision 
        will help solidify csimsoft's market position and will provide the marketing 
        and sales support that will ensure our continued growth."</p>
    <p>Ressler has over 19 years of experience working for both large companies and 
        small start-ups. He has worked for software companies, including a division 
        of Lexis-Nexis that provides document assembly and electronic publishing solutions 
        for large companies, government agencies, and law firms. He consulted with these large 
        organizations to design sophisticated networking and custom workflow solutions. 
        Ressler has experience developing strategic partner programs and managing 
        these relationships. He co-founded two successful companies where 
        he oversaw business structure, finance, and new business development. Ressler 
        was the president of Hybrid Dynamics Corporation (OTBB:HBDY). In these 
        positions he oversees all aspects of the public 
        company, including corporate structuring, SEC compliance and reporting, 
        investor relations, raising capital, and strategic direction. Ressler also 
        served on the Board of Trustees of the Top Flight Long-Short Fund (TOPFX), an 
        open-end, no-load mutual fund with over $17 million in assets.</p>
    <p>"csimsoft has a strong reputation for producing excellent tools for finite 
        element analysis," said Ressler. "And, it is quickly becoming the pre-processor 
        of choice for generating high-quality meshes for CFD." 
        csimsoft's growth over the past few years has sprung from the use of its 
        products by government contractors, academic, and research entities associated 
        with Sandia National Laboratories. In 2004, csimsoft was formed to address the needs
        of non-U.S. government users. Its user-base now extends worldwide.</p>
