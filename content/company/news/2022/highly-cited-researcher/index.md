Coreform President Dr. Michael Scott and Coreform Senior Advisor Thomas J.R. Hughes have been included in the prestigious annual [Highly Cited Researchers](https://recognition.webofscience.com/awards/highly-cited/2021/?campaignname=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_global_2021&campaignid=7014N000001r&utm_campaign=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_global_2021&utm_source=earned_coverage&utm_medium=press)™ 2021 list from Clarivate as “Cross-field” researchers, which indicates extraordinary influence in more than one field.

The highly anticipated Clarivate annual list identifies researchers who demonstrated significant influence in their chosen field or fields through the publication of multiple highly cited papers during the last decade. Their names are drawn from the publications that rank in the top 1% by citations for field and publication year in the [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/?campaignname=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_global_2021&campaignid=7014N000001r&utm_campaign=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_global_2021&utm_source=earned_coverage&utm_medium=press)™ citation index.

The methodology that determines the “who’s who” of influential researchers draws on the data and analysis performed by bibliometric experts and data scientists at the [Institute for Scientific Information](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/isi-institute-for-scientific-information/?campaignname=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_global_2021&campaignid=7014N000001r&utm_campaign=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_global_2021&utm_source=earned_coverage&utm_medium=press)™ at Clarivate. 

“This speaks to the importance of isogeometric analysis for industries from manufacturing to automotive to biomedical research,” says Dr. Scott. “There is a ton of interest in using new techniques to reduce production time and increase safety for customers, and IGA research bears directly on real-world improvements for industry.”

David Pendlebury, Senior Citation Analyst at the Institute for Scientific Information at Clarivate said: “It is increasingly important for nations and institutions to recognize and support the exceptional researchers who are driving the expansion of the world’s knowledge. This list identifies and celebrates exceptional individual researchers Coreform who are having a significant impact on the research community as evidenced by the rate at which their work is being cited by their peers. The research they have contributed is fueling the innovation, sustainability, health and security that is key for our society’s future.”
