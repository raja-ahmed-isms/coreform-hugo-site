Coreform LLC was recently recognized by the 2022 Utah Region Innovation awards for its pioneering work in Isogeometric analysis (IGA). The annual Utah Innovation Awards program recognizes the state’s vibrant community of innovators — from startups to established companies — and their breakthrough creations. In celebrating successful innovations, the awards program aims to build the state’s economy by acknowledging and rewarding the creative minds fueling innovation within it.

Coreform’s innovative software, Coreform IGA, radically accelerates computer simulations of the behavior of manufactured products like cars and phones. It does this by directly analyzing design data, which bypasses the  time-intensive approximation steps required by legacy software. 

“For decades, engineering simulation has been done on approximations of design models,” notes Coreform CEO Matthew Sederberg. “It takes weeks to build these approximations in the first place, and then what you're simulating on isn't the exact model you're going to manufacture anyway. What we've done at Coreform is invent a way to run a simulation on the exact data that will be manufactured, yielding much more accurate predictions of how the product will behave in real life.” 

Nominees in the Utah Innovation Awards program undergo a strict evaluation process by peers and leaders from the state’s business, civic, and academic communities. Pioneering innovations — whether products, services or processes — are judged on their novelty, market need, economic impact, and disruption of the status quo.

Ultimately, Coreform’s technology will enable automotive, defense, and other crucial industries to get safe products to market faster and disrupt the $7 billion computer-aided engineering market. Coreform IGA will enable global automotive companies to bring cars to market several months faster than current methods allow, and will enable companies to decrease their production costs by using more computer simulation, and eliminating costly physical prototypes. 

“Right now we’re focusing on the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries,” explains Greg Vernon, Director of Engineering at Coreform. “These are fields where it really matters that you know how a product will behave during and after it’s been manufactured, and where having more accurate predictions can make a real difference to people’s safety.”

Coreform IGA is currently available in beta form. For more information, visit www.coreform.com.

<strong>About the Utah Innovation Awards</strong><br>
Founded in 2002 by business law firm Stoel Rives LLP, and organized and hosted by the firm, the Utah Innovation Awards is the model for similar yearly programs in Idaho and the Sacramento Region over the past several years. Nominees in the program are evaluated by leaders within Utah’s business and academic communities, who vote to select the finalists and award winners. The result is a cohort of awe-inspiring innovations that impact a broad spectrum of markets and industries. 

In celebrating successful innovations, the awards program aims to build the state’s economy by acknowledging and rewarding the creative minds fueling innovation within it.

<strong>About Coreform LLC</strong><br>
Coreform develops next-generation computer-aided engineering software. Among Coreform’s founders are authorities in isogeometric analysis and widely cited researchers in the computer science field. The Coreform IGA solver is based on smooth CAD spline geometry, offering greater accuracy than the faceted meshes used in legacy CAE software.
