The Tire Society – the scientific professional organization for the tire industry – organizes an annual meeting for industry members and interested individuals. This annual conference is a forum for engineers, scientists, users, policymakers, students, and advocates to learn about innovations that will drive the tire industry in the future. Coreform, an innovator in computer simulation for engineering, offers a novel solution for improving the manufacturing of energy efficient, low rolling resistance, tire treads.
“We are pleased to sponsor this conference and the Tire Society’s efforts to improve safety and efficiency for the automotive industry.” notes Matt Sederberg, CEO of Coreform. “I’m looking forward to discussing how our innovative software can help them in those efforts.” 
The Tire Society was established with the mission to disseminate knowledge and stimulate the innovation of tires as it pertains to tire science, engineering and technology. The Annual Meeting and Conference of the Tire Society is held each year in Akron, Ohio. It is attended by some 150 to 200 of the tire industry’s leading engineers, scientists and academics. Conference topics range from industry-facing panels to science-based presentations.
The Tire Society is a not-for-profit Ohio corporation managed by a duly elected Executive Board of Tire Industry professionals who serve on a volunteer basis.
