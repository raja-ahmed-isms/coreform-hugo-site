[Coreform LLC](https://coreform.com), the fastest growing CAE company in the U.S. according to Inc. magazine, is the sponsor of the 2022 International Conference on Isogeometric Analysis (IGA). 

[This 10th International Conference on Isogeometric Analysis](http://iga2022.usacm.org) will be held on November 6-9, 2022 at the world-famous Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel in the Canadian Rockies, one of the most magnificent and awe-inspiring settings on earth. The focus of the conference is to bring together experts from academia and industry to discuss the most recent advances, novel applications and emerging research directions in the field of isogeometric analysis (IGA). 

Dr. Thomas J.R. Hughes, senior advisor at Coreform, will be the first plenary speaker at the conference. Several members of Coreform will attend and share the latest updates to the commercial Coreform IGA solver. 

“The International Conference on Isogeometric Analysis is the premier venue to share cutting-edge research and developments in this exciting field,” said Coreform CEO Matt Sederberg, “Over the past 17 years there have been over 3500 articles published on IGA, and this volume has continued to grow over the past two years, when the in-person meetings were canceled. We look forward to sharing our advances as well as learning of the other recent progress in the field.”

Topics of the conference include Mathematical Foundations of IGA; Adaptive and Unstructured Spline Technologies; Fast Formation and Solution Techniques; Boundary Element Methods; Design Space Exploration, Optimization and Uncertainty Quantification; Industrial Applications of IGA; IGA for Biomedical Applications; IGA for Solids and Structures; IGA for Fluids and Fluid-Structure Interaction; and New Emerging Frontiers in IGA.  There will also be a special Industrial Panel to discuss the current state-of-the-art, and challenges and opportunities for adoption of IGA at the industrial scale that Coreform will be participating on.
