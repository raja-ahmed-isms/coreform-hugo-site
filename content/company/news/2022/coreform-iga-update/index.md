On <strong>April 15, 2022 (9am MST)</strong> Coreformâ€™s Clint Nicely, will host a webinar. He will show how Coreform IGA can be used to run a single component linear statics simulation on a complex part prepared in Coreform Cubit without any defeaturing in under 15 minutes. He will then compare this Coreform IGA approach with the traditional defeatured meshing approach in Coreform Cubit to show the value of this new workflow.
