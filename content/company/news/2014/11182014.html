    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, November 18, 2014 &mdash; csimsoft, a leading developer
        of advanced meshing tools for the CFD and FEA communities, announced today
        the release of Trelis 15.1, a version upgrade of its popular Trelis meshing
        software. Trelis 15.1 includes the much anticipated Trelis SDK, with an
        export API for creating custom exporters, and integrated technology from
        MeshGems. Trelis 15.1 and a full list of updates are available at the csimsoft
        website.</p>
    <p>The MeshGems components add a significant improvement to Trelis's triangle
        and tetrahedral meshing capabilities. "csimsoft made the decision to integrate
        MeshGems Pre-CAD, CADSurf, and Tetra into Trelis 15.1 and could not be more
        pleased with that choice. The combination of all three of these components
        provides our users with the best possible triangle and tetrahedral meshing
        solution" commented Randy Morris, Managing Director. "The components are
        robust and are able to generate very high quality meshes across our large test
        suite of models."</p>

    <p>Trelis is based on the time-proven CUBIT<span class="symbolfont">&trade;</span> code that has been developed
        for more than two decades by csimsoft in conjunction with Sandia National
        Laboratories. Trelis 15.0 provides powerful meshing tools that produce
        high-quality meshes and enhance the user experience.</p>
