    <p>SILICON SLOPES, UT 4 May 2018 &mdash; Coreform LLC was recently awarded three new federal and state contracts and
        grants to advance the commercialization of its groundbreaking Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided
        Engineering (CAE) U-spline technology</p>
    <p>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Phase II SBIR from the United States Department of Energy</li>
        <li>A Phase II SBIR from the United States Naval Air Systems Command</li>
        <li>A Technology Acceleration Program (TAP) grant from the Utah Science Technology and Research Initiative
            (USTAR)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of these funding programs is highly competitive, and submissions are vetting for both technical promise and
        business potential. Coreform was granted these contracts based on the promise of its patent-pending U-spline
        technology and the strength of its experienced leadership team. Each contract will advance certain fundamental
        aspects of the U-spline technology while also addressing key applications of U-splines, such as integrating CAD
        and CAE and streamlining high-end structural dynamics simulation for automotive and other applications.</p>
    <p>"It's gratifying to see an increasing number of organizations recognize the need for a new technology capable of
        enabling truly integrated CAD/CAE and opening doors to new workflows, significant time savings, and higher
        accuracy," said Matthew Sederberg, Coreform CEO. "These contracts will build on a strong foundation of public
        and private partners funding the development of products based on Coreform's commercial isogeometric analysis
        technology."</p>
    <p>The USTAR TAP grant is a competitive grant designed to accelerate technology commercialization, shortening the
        traditional development phase and enabling Utah companies to compete for private capital sooner.</p>
    <p>"Coreform's U-spline technology offers promising applications across a variety of sectors ranging from the car
        you drive daily to work to advanced military aircraft. The TAP award is indicative of the company's successful
        performance to-date as well as representative of the technology's potential to generate economic growth in
        Utah," said Ivy Estabrooke, Ph.D., executive director of USTAR.</p>
    <p>Coreform is actively hiring additional researchers and programmers to join its world-class team and create the
        first native isogeometric analysis software, which promises higher accuracy and time savings over traditional
        FEA techniques. Please visit the Coreform careers page to learn more.</p>
    <p>About USTAR</p>
    <p>The Utah Science Technology and Research Initiative (USTAR) is the state's technology-based economic development
        agency. USTAR serves as a catalyst to develop ideas and research into marketable products and successful
        companies through its competitive grant and entrepreneur support programs. USTAR propels Utah's economy forward
        by supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly in the non-IT science and deep technology clusters.
        USTAR facilitates the diversification of the state's tech economy, increases private follow-on investments, and
        ensures more companies successfully launch and survive the initial technology development and incubation stages,
        or the so-called "Valley of Death." In doing so, USTAR helps create a rich innovation ecosystem that grows the
        state's economy, tax revenue, and workforce. For more information, visit www.ustar.org.</p>
