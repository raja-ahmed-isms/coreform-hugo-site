    <p>AMERICAN FORK, UTAH, February 28, 2018 &mdash; csimsoft, a leading developer of simulation tools for
        computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis, today announced the general release of Trelis 16.5.
    </p>
    <p>The release includes meshing improvements to the tetmesher include improved triangle and tetrahedral algorithms
        that increase the success of generating a tetrahedral mesh of complex geometries. Additionally, the
        visualization subsystem has been updgraded to VTK 8.0, using OpenGL2. </p>
    <p>"Trelis gives engineers confidence that the mesh they send to their analysis tool will give them accurate
        results," said Paul Ressler, csimsoft Director of Sales and Marketing. "We focus on meshing so engineers can
        spend their time doing engineering."</p>
