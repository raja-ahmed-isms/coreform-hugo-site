                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Coreform's mission is to enable our customers to develop superior products using innovative engineering simulation 
                    software. We achieve this through deep technical expertise, unconstrained creativity, and ambitious vision.</p>
                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <div style="float: right;"><img src="/images/spline2.png"></div>
                <p>We believe that the current design and simulation workflow is broken. It is too computationally expensive to run highly 
                    accurate simulations, and it takes too long to prepare the simulation data from CAD models. We envision a world where 
                    companies can quickly and accurately move through the design-analyze-iterate process so that they can bring new products 
                    to market that will benefit the worldwide community.</p>
                <p>In keeping with our vision to be a world leader in innovative engineering simulation software, we are developing 
                    next-generation technology based on the same underlying technology used in CAD. This smooth-spline-based approach 
                    introduces unprecedented computational speed, robust predictive power, and lower element counts that enables our 
                    customers to reduce physical prototyping, increase product design iterations, and ultimately decrease time to market.</p>
                <h3>People</h3>
                <p>Our team has decades of experience successfully bringing new technology to market in CAD and CAE, and includes some 
                    of the top researchers in the field. Creating opportunities for professional and personal growth for our employees 
                    is at the core of who we are.</p>
                <p>We are partnering closely with forward-thinking automotive, defense, and other companies as we develop our software. 
                    We would love to talk with you about your simulation and design challenges and discuss how spline-based simulation 
                    can open up an entirely new regime of speed and accuracy!</p>
