<p>We demonstrate the use of Bézier projection to alleviate locking phenomena in structural mechanics applications
    of isogeometric analysis. We call this method Bézier $\bar{B}$ projection. To demonstrate the utility of the
    approach for both geometry and material locking phenomena we focus on transverse shear locking in Timoshenko
    beams and volumetric locking in nearly compressible linear elasticity although the approach can be applied
    generally to other types of locking phenemona as well.
    <!--Bézier projection is a local projection technique with 
    optimal approximation properties, which in many cases produces solutions that are comparable to global<sup> </sup>$L^2$ 
    projection. In the context of B̄ methods, the use of Bézier projection produces sparse stiffness matrices with only 
    a slight increase in bandwidth when compared to standard displacement-based methods. Of particular importance is 
    that the approach is applicable to any spline representation that can be written in Bézier form like NURBS, T-splines, 
    LR-splines, etc. We discuss in detail how to integrate this approach into an existing finite element framework with 
    minimal disruption through the use of Bézier extraction operators and a newly introduced dual Bézier extraction operator. 
    We then demonstrate the behavior of the approach through several challenging benchmark problems.-->
