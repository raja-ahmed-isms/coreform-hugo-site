  In this paper we develop an isogeometric Bézier dual mortar method for coupling multi-patch Kirchhoff-Love shell structures.   The proposed approach weakly enforces the continuity of the solution at patch   interfaces through a dual mortar method and can be applied to both conforming   and non-conforming discretizations.   As the employed dual basis functions have local supports and satisfy the biorthogonality property, the resulting stiffness matrix is sparse.   In addition, the coupling accuracy is optimal because the dual basis possesses the polynomial reproduction property.   We also formulate the continuity constraints through the Rodrigues' rotation operator which gives an unified framework for coupling patches that are intersected with $G^1$ continuity as well as patches that meet at a kink.   Several linear and nonlinear examples demonstrated the performance and robustness of the proposed coupling techniques.
