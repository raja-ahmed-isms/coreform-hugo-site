<p>In this paper we develop the isogeometric Bézier dual mortar method. It is based on Bézier extraction and 
    projection and is applicable to any spline space which can be represented in Bézier form (i.e., NURBS, 
    T-splines, LR-splines, etc.). The approach weakly enforces the continuity of the solution at patch 
    interfaces and the error can be adaptively controlled by leveraging the refineability of the underlying 
    dual spline basis without introducing any additional degrees of freedom. <!--We also develop weakly continuous 
    geometry as a particular application of isogeometric Bézier dual mortaring. Weakly continuous geometry is 
    a geometry description where the weak continuity constraints are built into properly modified Bézier 
    extraction operators. As a result, multi-patch models can be processed in a solver directly without having 
    to employ a mortaring solution strategy. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several challenging 
    benchmark problems.--></p>
