<p>We develop a mixed nonlinear isogeometric Reissner-Mindlin shell element for the analysis of thin-walled 
    structures that leverages Bézier dual basis functions to address both shear and membrane locking and to 
    improve the quality of computed stresses. The accuracy of computed solutions over coarse meshes, that 
    have highly non-interpolatory control meshes, is achieved through the application of a continuous rotational 
    approach. <!--The starting point of the formulation is the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle with 
    independent displacement, membrane, and shear strains as the unknown fields. To overcome locking, the strain 
    variables are  interpolated with lower-order spline bases while the variations of the strain variables are 
    interpolated with the corresponding Bézier dual bases. Leveraging the biorthogonality property of the Bézier 
    dual basis, the strain variables are condensed out of the system with only a slight increase in the bandwidth 
    of the resulting linear system. The condensed approach preserves the accuracy of the non-condensed mixed 
    approach but with fewer degrees of freedom. From a practical point of view, since the Bézier dual basis is 
    completely specified through Bézier extraction, any spline space that admits Bézier extraction can utilize 
    the proposed approach directly.--></p>
