<p>In this paper, we present an algorithm to construct enriched Bézier dual basis functions that can reproduce 
    higher-order polynomials. Our construction is unique in that it is based on Bézier extraction and projection, 
    allowing it to be used for tensor product and unstructured polynomial spline spaces, is well-conditioned, 
    and is quadrature-free. When used as a basis for dual mortar methods, optimal approximations are achieved 
    for both second- and fourth-order problems. <!--In the context of fourth-order problems, both $C^0$ and $C^1$ 
    continuity constraints must be applied at each intersection. We develop a novel geometry-independent $C^1$ 
    continuity constraint that also preserves the sparsity of the coupled problem. The performance of the proposed 
    formulation is verified through several challenging second- and fourth-order problems.--></p>
