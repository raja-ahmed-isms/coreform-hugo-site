<p>In  contrast  to  the  laborious  and  error-prone  process  of  translating  computer-aided  design  
    (CAD)  into  computer-aided  engineering  (CAE)  models,  isogeometric  analysis  (IGA)  performs  
    the  finite  element  analysis (FEA) simulation directly on CAD geometry, using smooth spline basis 
    functions. LS-DYNA is a  leader  in  the  industrial  adoption  of  IGA,  and  has  recently  made  
    a  significant  enhancement  to  broaden the possible use of IGA within LS-DYNA. <!--<strong>*IGA_INCLUDE_BEZIER</strong> 
    is a new keyword that was recently implemented in LS-DYNA to enable the use  of  unstructured  spline  
    models  such  as  U-splines  and  T-splines.  This  is  significant  because  it  allows for more complex 
    models to be used for IGA in LS-DYNA.--></p>
