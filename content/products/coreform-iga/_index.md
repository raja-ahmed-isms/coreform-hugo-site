# Radically accelerate your engineering processes

Coreform IGA is a solver that runs directly on lattice structures, CAD, and stl files. Unlike traditional FEA that first requires geometry to be defeatured and meshed, Coreform IGA is based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) technology and accepts a broad range of inputs and file formats.

## No defeaturing or meshing required
Coreform IGA offers a full spectrum of input options and flexible modeling, allowing engineers to optimize manual effort for a desired solution solve time. Shown below is Coreform’s “Flex IGA” technology, which is an enhanced generalization of both immersed and traditional finite element analysis (FEA) approaches. Using Flex IGA, engineers can choose the level of effort they wish to spend to prepare design models for simulation, ranging from near-zero effort by automatically creating a bounding box simulation domain enveloping the model, to a progressively tighter fit of the spline simulation domain to the geometry to enable faster solve times.

# Faster overall time to solution with greater precision
Coreform IGA is an isogeometric analysis solver for non-linear structural mechanics. Coreform IGA leverages the power of smooth splines
to deliver faster FEA solutions. It enables analysts to calibrate simulation accuracy and speed to fit any stage of the product development process.
Legacy FEA solvers require time-consuming mesh generation for every simulation. The modern Coreform IGA solver is built to run nonlinear simulations directly on CAD, scanned data, meshes, and implicit lattice structures.

### Greater accuracy
The superiority of smooth spline basis functions gives Coreform IGA greater accuracy per degree of freedom than traditional FEA.
### Tight CAD connection
CAD models use smooth splines to precisely represent real world shapes. Coreform IGA can use these models directly even at very coarse element densities.
### More efficient compute
Coreform IGA leverages patent-pending U- splines to optimize computational efficiency through unique local h (element density), p (degree), and k (smoothness) adaptivity.

# Superior robustness and efficiency
Spline basis functions provide
superior robustness and efficiency over traditional FEA. Coreform IGA promises faster overall time to
solution with improved accuracy. -->

<!-- ### Dial in optimal levels of automation for varying analysis needs
Coreform IGA allows analysts to combine immersed, body-fitted and partially body-fitted domains into a single simulation. This allows analyses to be tailored to the problem at hand, with the flexibility to use precise meshing of critical features or automated quadrature computation directly on CAD models, to meet a wide range of analysis needs. -->
