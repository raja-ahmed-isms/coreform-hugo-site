            <br><p>The idea at the heart of Coreform technology was introduced in 2005. Termed isogeometric analysis (IGA) in the academic literature, 
            it was conceived by Coreform senior advisor Dr. Thomas J.R. Hughes. Subsequent research in the IGA field has been extraordinarily dynamic, 
            with Coreform founders and researchers contributing both important groundwork and continuing key advances. These reports highlight an overview of key IGA papers published in the community, as well as emerging research from 
            Coreform. </p>

                <!-- Spline-based simulation is usually called isogeometric analysis (IGA) in academia. Coreform Senior Advisor Dr. Tom 
                Hughes is the father of the IGA movement, and many Coreform co-founders are prominent members of the IGA community. 
                These reports highlight an overview of key IGA papers published in the community, as well as emerging research from 
                Coreform. Coreformâ€™s team also has deep expertise in meshing from our decades long collaboration with Sandia National 
                Laboratory, and we share some of our published research here. --> </p>
