<p>Sweeping algorithms provide the ability to generate all hexahedral meshes on a wide variety of three-dimensional bodies. The
    work presented here provides a method to refine these meshes by first defining a path through either the source or the target mesh
    and next by locating the sweeping layer to initiate the refinement. A major contribution of this work is the ability to
    automatically find a minimal distance path through the target or source mesh.
