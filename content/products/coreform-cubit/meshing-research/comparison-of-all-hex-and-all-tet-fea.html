<p>This paper compares the accuracy of elastic and elastio-plastic solid continuum finite
    element analyses modeled with either all hexagonal or all tetrahedral meshes. Eigenvalues
    of element stiffness matrices, linear static displacements and stresses, dynamic modal
    frequencies, and plastic flow values in are computed and compared. Elements with both
    linear and quadratic displacement functions are evaluated.
