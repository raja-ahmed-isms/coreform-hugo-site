<p>This paper presents methods and applications of sheet insertion in a
    hexahedral mesh. A hexahedral sheet is dual to a layer of hexahedra in a hexahedral
    mesh. Because of symmetries within a hexahedral element, every hexahedral mesh
    can be viewed as a collection of these sheets. It is possible to insert new sheets into
    an existing mesh, and these new sheets can be used to define new mesh boundaries,
    refine the mesh, or in some cases can be used to improve quality in an existing mesh.
