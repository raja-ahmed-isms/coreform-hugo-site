<p>This is a report of the current status of the Hex-Tet algorithm as implemented in the CUBIT
    toolset. The Hex-Tet algorithm begins by generating a partial hex mesh using an advancing front
    “Plastering” algorithm. The boundary of any remaining void is optionally “cleaned-up” to improve its
    shape and/or other properties. The quad boundary is then converted to a triangular boundary by one of
    three available methods. Finally, the triangle-bounded void is filled with tetrahedra using the tet-generation
    capabilities within CUBIT.
