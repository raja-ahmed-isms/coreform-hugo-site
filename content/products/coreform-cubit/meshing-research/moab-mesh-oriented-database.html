<p>MOAB is a component for representing and evaluating mesh data. MOAB can store structured
    and unstructured mesh, consisting of elements in the finite element “zoo”. The functional
    interface to MOAB is simple yet powerful, allowing the representation of many types of metadata
    commonly found on the mesh.
