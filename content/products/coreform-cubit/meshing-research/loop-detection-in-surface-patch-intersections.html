<p>A condition is presented for guaranteeing that all branches of the curve of intersection of two parametric 
    surfaces patches contain a point on at least one of the patch boundary curves. This is of value because it 
    eliminates a robustness limitation which arises when computing surface intersections using the marching method, 
    namely, assuring that all branches of the intersection curve have been found.
