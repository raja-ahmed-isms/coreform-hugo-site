<p>A new all-hexahedral meshing algorithm, referred to as “Geode”, is described. This algorithm is the
    combination of hex/tet plastering, dicing, and a new 26-hex transition element template.The algorithm is described
    in detail, and examples are given of problems meshed with this algorithm.
