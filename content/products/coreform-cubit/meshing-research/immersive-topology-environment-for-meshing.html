<p>The Immersive Topology Environment for Meshing (ITEM) is a wizardlike environment, 
    built on top of the CUBIT Geometry and Meshing Toolkit. ITEM
    is focused on three main objectives: 1) guiding the user through the simulation
    model preparation workflow; 2) providing the user with intelligent options based
    upon the current state of the model; and 3) where appropriate, automating as much
    of the process as possible.
