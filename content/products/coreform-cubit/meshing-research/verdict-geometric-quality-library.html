<p>Verdict is a collection of subroutines for evaluating the geometric qualities of triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, 
    and hexahedra using a variety of metrics. A metric is a real number assigned to one of these shapes depending on its 
    particular vertex coordinates. These metrics are used to evaluate the input to finite element, finite volume,
    boundary element, and other types of solvers that approximate the solution to partial
    differential equations defined over regions of space.
