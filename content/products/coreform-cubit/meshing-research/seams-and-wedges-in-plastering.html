<p>This paper describes mesh correction techniques necessary for meshing an arbitrary volume with a 
    completely hexahedral mesh. Specifically, it describes seams and wedges, mechanisms that overcome 
    major hurdles encountered in the preliminary work on the plastering algorithm. The plastering 
    algorithm iteratively projects layers of elements inward from a quadrilateral discretization of 
    the volume's bounding faces.
