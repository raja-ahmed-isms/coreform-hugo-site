## The path forward for GAMBIT CFD Users

Support and development of GAMBIT has been discontinued; however, Coreform Cubit is an actively developed and supported software that will be familiar and intuitive to GAMBIT users. Many years ago, GAMBIT was branched from the Cubit meshing code, while Cubit development continued at Sandia National Laboratories and has been extended by Coreform. [Coreform Cubit](/products/coreform-cubit) enables the shortest path to an appropriate mesh for GAMBIT users.

Many GAMBIT users are not aware that many years ago, GAMBIT was branched from the Cubit meshing code and developed specifically for CFD. GAMBIT was later sold to ANSYS, and support and development of GAMBIT was discontinued. Cubit development continued at Sandia National Laboratories. 

Coreform is the exclusive commercial distributor of the Cubit meshing technology from Sandia National Laboratories and has extended the Cubit technology for commercial use in its Coreform Cubit product.  Coreform Cubit is a comprehensive toolset for high-quality FEA and CFD mesh generation that provides a similar user experience as GAMBIT. Coreform Cubit enables the shortest path to an appropriate mesh for GAMBIT users.

	<p>Our team has been using Coreform Cubit for CFD meshing since 2015 when we switched over from GAMBIT. Cubit is a reliable meshing software capable of building very large and complex computational meshes for CFD simulation that just works!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash;Ed Wicklein, Principal Technologist</p>

Many GAMBIT users have already found Coreform Cubit to be a familiar and excellent upgrade to their meshing needs. For example, Carollo switched from GAMBIT to Coreform Cubit in and has been successfully using Cubit since 2015. Coreform Cubit has a similar workflow to GAMBIT coupled with additional advanced meshing capabilities including boundary layer technology that Carollo finds is superior to that of GAMBIT.

Coreform Cubit enables quickly moving from CAD to a complete CFD model through geometry editing, comprehensive meshing. This comprehensive capability is further supported by multiple automation capabilities. Coreform Cubit provides fully automated and semi-automated meshing routines, manual methods that provide more control, or combinations of both to ensure the highest quality model discretization that leverages state-of-the-art hex dominant and quad-dominant meshing.

Coreform Cubit is being continually enhanced with new meshing capabilities and user interface improvements. Coreform Cubit works well with both Fluent and OpenFOAM.
