            <p><br/>Coreform Cubit is conveniently licensed as either a node-locked (standalone) or floating
            (network) license to meet your organization's needs. Because Coreform Cubit is licensed
            annually, you are always entitled to the latest version upgrades and maintenance releases throughout the entire year.</p>
            <p>We can help you choose the licensing options that makes sense
            for your organization. <a href="/company/contact">Contact Coreform</a> today.</p>

            <h3 class="section-subhead">Node-locked or floating.</h3>
                <div class="inner">
                    <p>Licenses can be purchased for a specific computer or for shared use over
                        a network. A node-locked license permits the use of Coreform Cubit on a
                        specific computer while a floating license allows anyone on a
                        local area network to access Coreform Cubit based on the number of concurrent
                        licenses purchased. For example, a single floating license will
                        allow anyone on the network to use Coreform Cubit, one person at a time.</p>
                    <h5>Node-locked License</h5>
                    <p>When Coreform Cubit is installed and activated on a standalone computer,
                        the Coreform Cubit license is tied to that computer. If you
                        upgrade or change your computer, the license can be transfered.</p>
                    <h5>Floating License</h5>
                <img src="/images/network.jpg" align="right" style="padding-right: 100px; padding-left: 10px"/>
                    <p>A floating license can be shared by network users. The Coreform Cubit license manager is installed and the license is activated on a network
                        node or network server. Then, install Coreform Cubit software on the individual network computers that will use Coreform Cubit. Network computers do not need to run the
                        same operating system to share the license.</p>
                    <ul class="list-indent">
                        <li><strong>Using a Workstation as License Server</strong>. Coreform Cubit
                            can be installed and activated on a computer that is visible
                            to other computers over the network. This computer acts as
                            the license server. Then, Coreform Cubit can be installed on other
                            network computers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Using a Network Server as License Server</strong>.
                            The Coreform Cubit license manager can be installed and activated
                            on a network server. Then, Coreform Cubit can be installed on other
                            network computers.<br/><br/></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>NOTE: The Coreform Cubit license is activated on the license server and controls the number of concurrent users. Network computers do not need to be activated.</p>

            <p>Because Coreform Cubit is "powered by CUBIT", CUBIT customers with an annual
                lease or a current maintenance program can upgrade to Coreform Cubit FEA&trade;
                or Coreform Cubit CFD&trade; as a regular version upgrade. Simply <a href="/company/contact">

                    CUBIT users can upgrade to Coreform Cubit Pro&trade; for an additional cost.</p>
            <p>Coreform Cubit still uses the CUBIT .cub and .jou file formats.</p>

                plan that meets your company's needs.</p>
