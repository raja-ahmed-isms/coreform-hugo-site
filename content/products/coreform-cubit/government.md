## History of Coreform Cubit
In 1998, Sandia National Laboratories began contracting with the highly skilled mesh experts at Computer Simulation Software (csimsoft) as an integral part of the Cubit development team. In 2006, Sandia made Cubit available for commercial use through csimsoft under the brand of Trelis. Coreform acquired csimsoft in 2019, and in 2020 signed an agreement with Sandia to formally become the exclusive distributors of Cubit. As part of this new agreement, Trelis was rebranded to Coreform Cubit.
