<!-- # Explore Flex<sup>TM</sup> IGA: fully automatic isogeometric modeling  -->

<!-- ## Introducing the radical versatility of Flex<sup>TM</sup> modeling -->

<!-- ## Radically versatile, hex-quality modeling for analysis in the Coreform IGA solver

The increased accuracy and efficiency unlocked by Coreform's IGA technology make it possible to achieve industry-grade solution accuracy not only from the traditional body-fitted meshing approach, but also from highly automated immersed methods previously suited only for early-stage preliminary design checks.

The result is the Flex<sup>TM</sup> IGA modeling approach, a rigorously derived, patent-pending way to build and analyze models in computer-aided engineering that encompasses and unifies a continuum of methods from standard FEA to fully automated numerical methods.

## Flex IGA: brand new ways to balance speed and accuracy
Some regions are captured with a conforming hex mesh, while other regions are immersed within the mesh.  Requires only a few minutes to build. Resolves the geometric features through the use of high-order U-splines. Exact CAD model represented throughout the simulation. Ready for analysis with the Coreform IGA solver. ![Flex IGA modeling](hex-meshing-flexflexlgT.png)
