# Powerful, versatile preprocessing for scientific and commercial solvers
Coreform Cubit software has been relied on for over two decades to solve the toughest meshing problems for a wide range of scientific research and commercial applications. 
* valued for 
    * its comprehensive toolset, including geometry tools for converting between non-manifold and manifold geometry 
    * the versatility afforded by its expansive stock of methods and detailed controls for mesh generation and modification
    * structured and unstructured?
    * also for its powerful journaling and Python scripting capabilities and deep customization available via SDK   

Take a look at just a few of the solver codes that have adopted Coreform Cubit as their first-choice preprocessor. 

* MOOSE  
Cubit is the preferred preprocessor for Idaho National Laboratory's open-source Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE), which has become a standard in nuclear energy simulation software, with significant and growing adoption in other industrial applications as well. MOOSE is a powerfully flexible, modular platform that allows tailored construction of multiphysics simulation codes/executables from hundreds of available physics capabilities. It also has exceptional facilities for parallel, flexibly coupled solves between multiple independent codes and external software.

Example applications in MOOSE:
* 

* DAGMC  

* Ierus  

* Akselos?  

* Pylith geo?

* Crystal fracture?
