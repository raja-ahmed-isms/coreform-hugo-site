            <p class="page_collapsible">What is Coreform Cubit?<span></span></p>

            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Coreform Cubit is an advanced meshing pre-processor based on decades of
                    Cubit
                    development. Coreform Cubit is used to create high quality hex and tet meshes for finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics. Coreform Cubit meshes are used in many solvers across industries, including aerospace, defense, nuclear energy, and automotive. 
                    Coreform Cubit is based on the CUBIT&#174; technology developed at Sandia National Laboratories, which Coreform has an exclusive commercial license to distribute. </p>

            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
                    <!-- Some people think of Trelis as CUBIT Plus.
                    In 2010, csimsoft began preparing the CUBIT code for commercial
                    use. In 2013, csimsoft launched Trelis for commercial and
                    academic customers. Trelis will still include the on-going
                    joint csimsoft and Sandia development to the CUBIT kernel. -->
                    Coreform is the exclusive commercial distributor of the CUBIT technology. Coreform Cubit is very similar to CUBIT, but may also contain additional functionality. See the latest version's 
                    <a href="/products/downloads/">latest version's release notes</a> for up-to-date information on Coreform Cubit enhancements.

            <p class="page_collapsible">How many mesh elements can Coreform Cubit generate?<span></span></p>
            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The number of elements depends on whether
                    you are running a 32- or 64-bit system and the amount of
                    memory your system has. When a computer needs to swap to
                    disk, the meshing time is increased. There are Coreform Cubit users
                    who are regularly generating meshes over 500 million elements
                    on a 64-bit Windows machine with 128 gigabytes of memory.
                    Coreform Cubit can generate a 27 million element mesh on an 8 gigabyte
                    machine in less than a minute and over 100 million element
                    mesh on a 32 gigabyte machine in 30 minutes.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Coreform Cubit can generate
                    tetrahedral, hexahedral, and hybrid meshes.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="page_collapsible">Does Coreform Cubit support hybrid meshing?<span></span></p>
            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, Coreform Cubit supports hybrid
                    meshes. Pyramids and wedges can be used on adjacent surfaces to transition between volumes with
                    tet and hex meshes.</p>

            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Coreform Cubit requires a valid license file before it
                    will launch. The license file can be located on the same computer
                    as Coreform Cubit or on a network license server. The license type that
                    you purchased will determine whether Coreform Cubit can be run on network
                    or a standalone computer. See <a href="/support/activation/cubit/activate" target="_blank">Product

                    for more information on installing Coreform Cubit on a stand-alone computer or network.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Network installations require that additional
                    software called RLM-Server license manager be installed on a computer that
                    will act as the license server for network computers that will run Coreform Cubit.
                    RLM-Server and installation instructions are available <a href="/support/downloads/"

            <p class="page_collapsible">Where are my license files saved on my computer?<span></span></p>
            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Coreform Cubit will save license files to a certain directory, and will read any license files
                    placed there by the user.</p>
                <p><strong>Before 2021.5:</strong> </p>
                    <p>In older versions of Coreform Cubit, the license files are written to the /bin/licenses 
                    folder in the Cubit installation directory.</p>
                <p><strong>2021.5 and later:</strong></p>
                <p>In Coreform Cubit 2021.5, license files are written to a user data folder that will persist
                    across Cubit versions.  This means that you will not ordinarily have to reactivate Cubit when updating your software.  The 
                    /bin/licenses directory is also still checked by Coreform Cubit, and any license files placed there will also be read.  The 
                    user data folders differ by platform.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you receive this error in the Product Activation window,
                    you might not have write permission to the /bin/licenses folder in the Coreform Cubit installation directory. However,
                    the license may have been generated on the Coreform server. Visit
                    your <a href="http://coreform.com/account/licenses.jsp" target="_blank">My Licenses</a>
                    page and scroll to the bottom of the page to download the license file to
                    the Coreform Cubit /bin/license folder.</p>
                <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If this error occurs on the RLM-Server network server,
                    the license file should be downloaded to the RLM-Server folder. (See <i>Network Troubleshooting</i>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Coreform uses the RLM license manager from Reprise Softaware. Reprise has

            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> On Windows, when you install a new version of Cubit sometimes the user interface does not initialize correctly. The 3D view does not show, the toolbars aren't present, and the window is mostly blank.
This occurs when Cubit can't load its plugins correctly. Usually the reason for this is that Cubit is loading libraries from incorrect locations, which causes conflicts. On Windows, programs will search every directory present in the PATH environment variable for libraries to load.
If there's an older version of Cubit or another scientific program present in the PATH environment variable, there may be library files with the same name as what Cubit expects but different versions. Our new installation of Cubit will load the library file, but because it's the wrong version Cubit won't be able to get everything it needs from it, and will stop initializing.To fix this issue, you will need to audit your PATH environment variable:</p>

            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> RLM-Server is the current name of the license server for managing
                    floating licenses. It was previously named TrelisLM. RLM-Server includes a GUI for simplifying the
                    activation process.
                    <!--(Before the Cubit rebranding, it was called TrelisLM. To avoid confusion between Trelis and TrelisLM,
                    we renamed the server software RLM-Server.)-->

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li>Did you install RLM-Server and activate the license on the computer you will use
                        as the license server?<br /><br />For network installations, two separate
                        software programs must be installed. RLM-Server is the server software
                        and Coreform Cubit is the client software. RLM-Server is available
                        at <a href="/support/downloads" target="_blank">RLM-Server Downloads</a><br /><br /></li>
                    <li>Did you activate the computer with RLM-Server installed?<br /><br />If
                        RLM-Server is activated a license file with a .lic extension will be
                        in the RLM-Server folder. Use the <i>rlm_activate</i> utility in the
                        RLM-Server folder to activate the software, or visit your license page
                        in your Coreform account. See <a href="/support/activation/rlmserverinstall/"
                            target="_blank">RLM-Server
                            Installation Instructions</a> for more information.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li>Is the Coreform ISV server running?<br /><br />Sometimes after activation,
                        the license server software needs to be restarted (Does not require a
                        reboot of the machine). Check to see that the Coreform server is running.
                        In a web browser on the server, type http://localhost:5053. This should
                        open the Reprise License Server Administration page. In the left column,
                        click Status. You should see three tables. In the ISV Servers table you
                        should see Coreform port 5055 running Yes. If not, click on Reread/Restart
                        Servers in the left column. Check again by clicking Status.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li>Is there another RLM ISV server also using port 5055?<br /><br />Other
                        software using RLM may be using the same port number. Change the port
                        number for Coreform Cubit to avoid conflicts.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li>Did you install and configure Coreform Cubit on the client?<br /><br />After RLM-Server
                        is installed and activated (A .lic file is in the RLM-Server folder),
                        ensure that Coreform Cubit is configured properly on each network client computer.
                        When Coreform Cubit launches, it will request a license from the RLM-Server license
                        server, so it needs to know where RLM-Server is located. The client machine
                        must be able to access the server over the network. In the Coreform Cubit Product
                        Activation window, select Floating: Connect to a license server. Enter
                        the Hostname or IP Address of the computer where RLM-Server is installed.
                        The default port is 5053. The Product Activation window is under the Help menu.<br /></li>

            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> There may be several possible reasons why Coreform Cubit
                    is not able to access the RLM-Server server license:</p>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li><strong>Coreform Cubit/license version mismatch</strong>. If the version
                        of Coreform Cubit is newer than the version permitted by the floating license,
                        update the license or use the matching version of Coreform Cubit. This may
                        occur when a new version of Coreform Cubit is released. The download for
                        Coreform Cubit is updated but the floating license on the license server
                        is not updated. The floating license can be updated by running
                        the activation process again using the product key found on the
                        My Licenses page.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li><strong>RLM-Server is not installed</strong>. Coreform Cubit and
                        RLM-Server must be installed for a floating license to work.
                        RLM-Server is the server software that is installed on a
                        network server or workstation that will act as the license server.
                        It must be installed and activated with a valid license file
                        before a network installation of Coreform Cubit can be used.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li><strong>RLM-Server is not activated</strong>. After installing
                        RLM-Server, use the rlm_activate command line utility located
                        in the RLM-Server installation folder to activate RLM-Server over
                        the Internet. It will communicate with the Coreform server and
                        download a floating license file.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li><strong>RLM-Server is not running</strong>. During the installation,
                        RLM-Server should start automatically. To check the status of
                        the server, type "<a href="http://localhost:5054/" target="_blank">http://localhost:5054/</a>"
                        in
                        a web browser. The Reprise License Server Adminstration page will open.
                        On the left sidebar can click <i>Status</i> to see if the Coreform
                        server is running. To start the Coreform server, click <i>Reread/Restart
                            Servers</i>.<br /><br /></li>
                    <li><strong>Network communication error</strong>. RLM-Server must be
                        installed on a network server or workstation that acts as the license server.
                        This server must be accessible to the workstation where Coreform Cubit is installed.
                        This includes configuring a firewall to allow access to the server.
                        Coreform Cubit will not work properly if it cannot communicate with RLM-Server.</li>

            <p class="page_collapsible">How to Configure RLM to Manage Software from Multiple Vendors<span></span></p>
            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> RLM-Server is based on RLM from Reprise Software.
                    Reprise provides two methods for using RLM with software from two
                    different software vendors:</p>
                <ul class="indent">
                    <li>Separate RLM installations and ISV servers</li>
                    <li>Single RLM installation that manages two ISV servers (recommended)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is recommended that you use a single RLM installation and have it
                    manage two ISV servers. By default, the RLM server uses port 5053
                    to communicate with the ISV software. All ISV software should use the same port 5053,
                    but each ISV server will use a unique port. For example, ISV A on port 5055 and ISV B
                    on port 5056 would both use port 5053 to communicate with the RLM license server.
                    All ISV license files should be in the same folder.</p>

            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The RLM-Server log will show a DENIED message when
                    Coreform Cubit requests a license for features that the serve does not have.
                    To suppress this message, create a text file in the RLM-Server
                    installation called "coreform.opt" with the text "NOLOG denied".
                    While with will suppress the DENIED license message, it may
                    potentially limit the ability to identify when licenses are

            <p class="page_collapsible">How do I setup Coreform Cubit on a cluster?<span></span></p>
            <div class="collapsing-content">
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> There are two ways you might setup Coreform Cubit on a HPC
                    cluster. The license manager can be installed on a node or a computer
                    not part of the cluster. Any Coreform Cubit installation on an HPC should
                    have a floating license, regardless of where the RLM server is installed.</p>
                <p>First Option: We recommend that RLM-Server be installed on a
                    computer (Windows or Linux) that is not part of the HPC cluster.
                    The instructions for installing and activating RLM-Server on that
                    computer are the same as any normal computer (See <a href="/support/activation/rlmserverinstall"
                        target="_blank">Coreform Cubit
                        Network Installation Instructions</a>). If the external computer has an
                    Internet connection, you can run the rlm_activation on that node, otherwise you
                    can use the <a href="/support/activation/activateoffline">Offline Activation</a> option. </p>
                <p>After the RLM-Server is installed and the license activated, install Coreform Cubit
                    software on the cluster nodes and point back to the external machine running the
                    license manager. This can be done by starting Coreform Cubit on the node and when the
                    Activation Dialog appears, enter the IP address or hostname of the license server,
                    or by manually creating a remote.lic file in the /bin/licenses folder of each
                    node. Cluster nodes can have a shared file system, so it is likely that
                    Coreform Cubit is installed 'once' with only one remote.lic file to create, then
                    that installation is used by multiple nodes in the cluster.</p>
                <p>Second Option: The RLM-Server can be run on a node on the cluster. The license
                    activation is done in the same way as described in the first option, depending on
                    whether the node has Internet connection or not.</p>
                <p>After the RLM-Server is installed on a node, install Coreform Cubit software on the cluster
                    nodes. You can manually create a remote.lic file in the /bin/licenses folder of
                    the node, or start Coreform Cubit on each node and when the Activation Dialog appears,
                    enter the IP address or hostname of the server node within the cluster instead
                    of the IP address or name of the cluster itself.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Indirect GLX was disabled by default in Xorg 1.17. Starting with XQuartz version 2.7.9, to
                    enable indirect GLX and to allow remote visualization on the cluster you will have to issue at the
                    terminal command prompt of your mac: <i>defaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 enable_iglx -bool
                        true</i></p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Coreform Cubit's graphics engine may not work properly if you are using the
