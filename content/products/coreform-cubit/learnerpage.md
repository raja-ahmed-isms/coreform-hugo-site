Multi-step on-ramping. Following the T-splines model, I think. That will entail producing lots of short videos.

(Fast car theme: hitting road, gearing up, up to speed, )
(webinars link box on right)

1. The basics (T: 4 minute intro overview, sample files to explore in Rhino, eight short videos on major things to understand / functions)
2. Gearing up to make your first T-splines model (Two minute vid of easiest route to making a model, four minute tutorial with file)
3. Up to speed with workflows (sequence of five short videos on additional ways to create models, series of six sequentially expanding tutorials of example projects)
4. Time to make own projects (link to 40 more tutorials, plus user manual, forum, and infopage on live training)
5. Buy a license, post job for biddng on job board,
