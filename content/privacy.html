			<h1 class="section-subhead">Privacy policy</h1>

			<p>The privacy of your personal information is important to Coreform LLC and its affiliated legal entities ("Coreform", "we", "us", or similar terms). This Privacy Policy is intended as a general statement regarding collection and use of personal information for Coreform affiliated Web sites. We strive to collect, use and disclose personal information consistent with the laws in the countries in which we collect personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to this Web site which is owned and operated by Coreform (as noted specifically on the first page of the Web site).</p>

			<p>In selected jurisdictions, Coreform affiliated entities may adopt unique privacy policy provisions to reflect the requirements of applicable local laws. When a separate provision is deemed necessary, notice will be provided.</p>

			<p>Although you can visit most Coreform web sites without providing any personal information, Coreform adheres to the following privacy principles on how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.</p>

			<h4>Privacy Practices</h4>

			<p><strong>Information Collection, Consent and Use.</strong> When you create a Coreform account, register on the Coreform web site, add profile information, or take other similar actions, we may collect or obtain from you, information including, but not limited to, your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, contact or profile preferences. We will use such information to allow us to contact you, to fulfill your requests, to seek your voluntary feedback on web site features or content, and to help fulfill the mission of Coreform. We may also use your personal information for internal purposes, including auditing, data analysis, and research. We will use your information for no other purposes unless we specifically inform you otherwise and obtain your prior consent if legally required. We will also make you aware of options to opt-out of or opt-in (as required by law) to certain features. Moreover, we grant individuals the opportunity to object to certain uses of their information.</p>

			<p><strong>Content Submissions.</strong> When you submit additional content through any Coreform web site, such as, but not limited to, sending messages, engaging in on-line chats, replying to surveys, or similar feature, your information will be stored on our system. While we intend that certain submissions using features on Coreform web sites are to remain private, we cannot guarantee the complete privacy of such submissions and may in some instances choose, or be legally required, to disclose such information to third parties as outlined in this policy. Some information you provide to Coreform web sites will be submitted with your express agreement that the submission is to be shared publicly. In such instances, others will have access to any personal information within such submission. We recommend caution in selecting which information you choose to include in such submissions to avoid causing harm or injury, or risk of harm or injury, to yourself or others.</p>

			<p>We are under no obligation to monitor such content, but reserve the right to do so in our sole discretion and are authorized to block or remove content we deem inappropriate or objectionable. We prohibit postings or submissions in any form and using any available tool on any Coreform web site, whether intended to be private to you or shared with the public, that are obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, defamatory, libelous, tortious, illegal, threatening, or otherwise inappropriate or objectionable. As we do not review all content submitted through every feature on each Coreform web site, we are unable to take protective measures in the event you provide content disclosing information about a person that is a victim of harm or abuse or is at risk of becoming a victim of harm or abuse.</p>

			<p><strong>Retention.</strong> We retain collected personal information for a reasonable period of time to fulfill the collection purpose and then delete it from our records.</p>

			<p><strong>Access.</strong> We endeavor to maintain personal information accurately and rely on you to ensure your personal information is complete and accurate. You may verify, correct, or remove your personal information through your web site specific registration or your profile. If you experience problems with modifying your personal information or other requests to update your personal information, you can contact us by sending an email to<a href="mailto:info@coreform.com">info@coreform.com</a>.</p>

			<h4>Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>

			<p>We regard your personal information as confidential and do not sell it to anyone. We do not share your personal information with other parties except in the following exceptions (or in other instances where we specifically inform the individual and obtain prior consent):</p>

			<p><strong>Third Party Services.</strong> We may provide personal information to third parties for their use in performing internal functions on our behalf (payment processing, maintenance, security, data analysis, hosting, and so forth). In such instances, the providers will be contractually required to protect the personal information from additional use or transfer in accordance with this privacy policy and industry standards.</p>
			<p>We may also use Google Analytics to gather statistics on site usage. This may involve the use of cookies. There are more details in our Cookies Policy and in Google's own privacy policy. Google may aggregate data they collect from their various services including Google Analytics, Google Translate, Google Maps and YouTube. You acknowledge and accept that we have no control over Google's data collection. You should look at Google's privacy policy for details of their data collection practices.</p>

			<p><strong>Partner Entities.</strong> We may transfer personal information to any affiliated entity to meet Coreform purposes. For online submissions of personal information, an individual's consent indicates an informed consent to the processing as well as informed consent to allow the transborder data transfer to the United States of America for the purposes for which it was provided.</p>

			<p><strong>Legal Requirements.</strong> We may access and disclose your personal information, posts, journaling, personal notes, content, or other submissions submitted to any Coreform web site if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order or otherwise required by law. Additionally, we may disclose your personal information and other information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to prevent a violation of our other agreements; to take precautions against liability; to protect the rights, property, or safety of the site, of any individual, or of the general public; to maintain and protect the security and integrity of our services or infrastructure; to protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; or to assist government enforcement agencies.</p>

			<h4>Protecting Information</h4>

			<p>We use technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information we receive against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration, and to protect its confidentiality. We regularly review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>

			<h4>Third-Party Data</h4>

			<p>Where local law permits, you may submit personal information of third parties, including contact information, to allow Coreform to make contact, make a delivery, or otherwise meet your request. The information collected will be used solely to facilitate your request. When providing personal information about anyone other than yourself, you must obtain the other person's informed consent if legally required.</p>

			<h4>Cookies, Clear GIFs, and Other Passive Data Collection-Tracking Technologies</h4>

			<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a browser when a user visits a Web site. A clear gif is a graphic file, rather than a text file, that is similar in function to a cookie. We use these and similar tools in our effort to improve individual site experiences. We do not link the information we store in cookies, clear gifs, or other tracking technologies to any personally identifiable information. When an individual requests pages from a Coreform site, our servers may also log the user's IP address in order to improve site administration. This information is used to produce usage statistics to help us better meet the needs of individual users and to determine specific interests. We do not link the IP address to any personal information.</p>

			<h4>Compliance and Questions Regarding the Privacy of Personal Information</h4>

			<p>We have a Coreform Data Privacy Officer to assist in ensuring compliance with this Privacy Policy and data security issues. This officer helps educate employees concerning compliance. Inquiries concerning this Privacy Policy or the security of personal information processed by Coreform may be sent via email or directly to the following:</p>

			<h4>Children's Privacy</h4>

			<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under age 13 from Coreform web sites. Minors 13 years of age or older should obtain permission from their parent or legal guardian before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe Internet use practices.</p>

			<h4>Third-Party Links</h4>

			<p>The Site may contain links to third parties' websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any third-party sites. For users' own protection, users should carefully review the policies of similar sites to ensure they meet users' personal expectations of privacy before either agreeing to their terms or using their websites.</p>

			<h4>Future Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>

			<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Privacy Policy at any time. When we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will post the changes on this page and update the revision date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. We encourage users to check the Privacy Policy to remain informed of any changes.</p>

			<h4>Effective Date</h4>
