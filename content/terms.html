            <p>By using this site, you agree to the following
                conditions. If you disagree with any of the conditions, do not use this site. We reserve
                the right to change these conditions at any time, so please check for changes when you
                use the site. Your continued use of the site following the posting of changes to these
                conditions means that you accept those changes.</p>
            <h4>Licenses and Restrictions</h4>
            <p>This site is owned and operated by Coreform LLC ("Coreform"). 
                All material found at this site (including visuals, text,
                icons, displays, databases, media, and general information), is owned or licensed by us.
                You may view, download, and print material from this site only for your personal,
                noncommercial use unless otherwise indicated. In addition, materials may be reproduced
                by media personnel for use in traditional public news forums unless otherwise indicated.
                You may not post material from this site on another web site or on a computer network
                without our permission. You may not transmit or distribute material from this site to
                other sites. You may not use this site or information found at this site (including the
                names and addresses of those who submitted information) for selling or promoting
                products or services, soliciting clients, or any other commercial purpose.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve sole discretion and right to deny, revoke, or
                limit use of this site, including reproduction. It is not our responsibility, however,
                to determine what "Fair Use" means for persons wishing to use materials from this site.
                That remains wholly a responsibility of the user. Further, we are not required to give
                additional source citations, nor to guarantee that the materials are cleared for
                alternate uses. Such ultimately remains the responsibility of the user. However, Coreform 
                maintains the right to prevent infringement of its materials and to interpret
                "Fair Use" as it understands the law.</p>
            <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
            <p>You agree that you will not individually, or as part of any collective effort, submit or
                post information to this site that could be deemed harmful or offensive to other users,
                nor will you impersonate another user in order to hide your identity or implicate
                another in such actions. You agree to do nothing that might disrupt the flow of data to
                and from this site, impact the service or performance of this site, or circumvent any of
                the controls or usage rules that we have implemented. You understand that the result of
                harmful or offensive actions may include revocation of your right to use this site and
                legal action against you.</p>
            <h4>Linking</h4>
            <p>For your convenience, this site may contain links to web sites operated by others. These
                sites are not maintained or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for their
                content. Although we have made a good faith effort to link only to tasteful, appropriate
                sites, some may contain inappropriate or objectionable material. If you find such
                material while using this site, please notify us immediately. We believe that those who
                make information available on the Internet expect that it will be publicly and widely
                available. Therefore, we believe that linking to other sites is legally permissible and
                consistent with the expectations of those who use the Internet. However, if access to a
                particular site should be restricted, the site operator should promptly notify us.</p>
            <h4>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h4>
            <p>This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah, United States of
                America, as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within the
                state, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Any action you bring
                to enforce this agreement or any matters related to this site shall be brought in either
                the state or federal courts located in Utah County, Utah, and you hereby consent
                and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating
                any such action. If any provision of this agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable
                in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall not be affected, unless we determine
                that the invalid or unenforceable provision is an essential term to the agreement, in
                which case we may at our sole discretion amend the agreement.</p>
            <h4>Limitations of Liability</h4>
            <p>We are not liable for any special or consequential damages resulting from your use of, or
                your inability to use, the materials in this site or any linked site, including, but not
                limited to, lost profits, business interruption and loss of programs or other data on
                your information handling system. In no event shall our total liability to you for all
                damages, losses, and causes of action exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for
                accessing this site or any linked site.</p>
