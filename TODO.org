#+TITLE: Todo Tasks
* TODO Integrate bulma.io [6/6]
This is needed to allow us the power to wrangle the existing css while providing sensible tooling to extend the website. This is also a way to allow us to shift from handcoded content pages to template and shortcode driven ones.
- [X] fix table background color so bulma does not set it
- [X] logo not showing up when desktop and wrong size when mobile
- [X] logo for trelis, crunch, cubit in page is likewise too big
- [X] spacing between some paragraphs is not enough
- [X] fix bullets to be in content
- [X] images and text not showing up side by side on trelis page
  turns out this was due size of the window difference between them 
* TODO Address other design debt [0/3]
- [-] dry out common elements for page hero heads [1/2]
  - [ ] extract parallax-window to template
  - [X] either switch to page bundles or specify featured image in md metadata for all pages
- [ ] Codify permalink layout so we don't manually place content into years
- [ ] replace images in main three with better quality versions
* TODO Remaining tasks for first redesign [7/11]
- [X] News component that can pivot to auto updating
- [X] IGA page
- [X] Convert home page to markdown and split out carolsel
- [ ] Figures inside the centering shortcode do not show up (similar to youtube issue)
- [ ] Add indication that the drawer can be opened (same issue on faq)
- [ ] split up scss so that pages can have color hinting in the headlines
- [X] Contact us partial should be tweaked
- [X] allow blurb with pram
  Looked ugly, opted to just do blurbs
- [ ] grey on bottom
- [X] align component - ragged inner
- [X] mis-sized images on iga
